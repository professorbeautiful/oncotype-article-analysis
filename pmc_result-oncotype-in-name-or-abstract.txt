TI  - Utilization and impact of 21-gene recurrence score assay for breast cancer in
      clinical practice across the United States: lessons learned from the 2010 to 2012
      National Cancer Data Base analysis.
PG  - 427-35
AB  - The aim of our study is to investigate patient selection for the 21-gene
      recurrence score assay (RS) for breast cancer (BC) and the RS impact on
      chemotherapy administration (Chemo) in clinical practice across the United States
      through the retrospective observational study of National Cancer Data Base (NCDB)
      patients from 2010 to 2012. NCDB captures ~70 % of all newly diagnosed
      malignancies in the USA annually. The 2010–2012 period depicts data from the
      beginning of the NCDB that required recording of molecular assays and their data 
      release in April 2015. De-identified demographic and clinical variables of
      patients that had RS results were analyzed. 513,080 patients had BC; 406,525 were
      estrogen receptor-positive (ER+). 74,334/91,651 patients with RS recorded as a
      numerical value (0–100) were analyzed (18.2 % of ER+). Patients’ ages ranged from
      18 to 90 (mean = 58.8, median = 59); 99.1 % were females. Patients of Caucasian
      race, from regions with <7 % having no high school education, and >$63,000 median
      household income were more likely to be tested than patients of other races,
      education, or income (p < 0.001). 58.1 % of tests were performed in ER+/lymph
      node-negative/>1 cm tumors; 16.4 % included ≥N1 disease; 9.9 % included T1a, T3, 
      Stage III and IV, or HER2-positive cancers. Low-risk RS result had 92.2 %
      negative predictive value for no Chemo. Intermediate-risk RS result had 40.1 %
      positive predictive value (PPV); high-risk RS had 81.2 % PPV for Chemo. RS is
      obtained in ~1/5 of ER + BC patients across the USA. Further studies
      investigating influence and implementation of the newest evidence-based
      management guidelines regarding patients’ selection for RS test and chemotherapy 
      administration upon obtaining of test results are warranted.

TI  - A Prospective Comparison of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score and the PAM50-Based
      Prosigna in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1237-47
AB  - Introduction: The 21-gene Recurrence Score® assay (Oncotype DX®, Genomic Health, 
      Inc.) is a validated predictor of recurrence risk/chemotherapy benefit in
      patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) early-stage breast cancer treated 
      with endocrine therapy. The Prosigna® assay (NanoString Technologies Inc.) is a
      validated prognosticator in postmenopausal patients with low-risk ER+ early-stage
      breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy. The assays were
      analytically/clinically developed and validated differently. This study focused
      on comparing recurrence risk estimates as determined by these assays and is the
      first blinded comparison of these assays on matched patient samples. Methods:
      Sequential breast cancer specimens from postmenopausal, node-negative, ER+
      patients treated at the Marin General Hospital were analyzed: first by the
      21-gene assay then by the Prosigna assay in an independent lab blinded to the
      Recurrence Score results. Results: The final analysis included 52 patients.
      Correlation between the Recurrence Score and the Prosigna assay results was poor 
      (r = 0.08). Agreement between risk classifications based on these assays was 54%;
      4/7 of patients classified as high risk by the Prosigna assay had low Recurrence 
      Score results. Two tumors with high Recurrence Score results had low ER
      expression (close to positivity threshold); both of which had a low/intermediate 
      Prosigna assay result. The Prosigna assay classified 73.1% and 23.1% of samples
      as luminal A and luminal B, respectively. A range of Recurrence Score results was
      observed within the subtypes; 83% of luminal B samples had a low Recurrence Score
      result. Conclusion: Consistent with prior comparisons between the 21-gene and
      other genomic assays, our study demonstrated substantial differences in the way
      patients are risk stratified, suggesting that the different assays are not
      interchangeable. Funding: Genomic Health, Inc. Electronic supplementary material:

TI  - The relationship between quantitative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      gene expression by the 21-gene reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
      assay and adjuvant trastuzumab benefit in Alliance N9831.
LID - 133
AB  - Introduction: The N9831 trial demonstrated the efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab
      for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) locally
      positive tumors by protein or gene analysis. We used the 21-gene assay to examine
      the association of quantitative HER2 messenger RNA (mRNA) gene expression and
      benefit from trastuzumab. Methods: N9831 tested the addition of trastuzumab to
      chemotherapy in stage I–III HER2-positive breast cancer. For two of the arms of
      the trial, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC-T) and
      doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel and trastuzumab
      concurrent chemotherapy-trastuzumab (AC-TH), recurrence score (RS) and HER2 mRNA 
      expression were determined by the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX®) (negative <10.7,
      equivocal 10.7 to <11.5, and positive ≥11.5 log2 expression units). Cox
      regression was used to assess the association of HER2 expression with trastuzumab
      benefit in preventing distant recurrence. Results: Median follow-up was
      7.4 years. Of 1,940 total patients, 901 had consent and sufficient tissue. HER2
      by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative in 130
      (14 %), equivocal in 85 (9 %), and positive in 686 (76 %) patients. Concordance
      between HER2 assessments was 95 % for RT-PCR versus central immunohistochemistry 
      (IHC) (>10 % positive cells = positive), 91 % for RT-PCR versus central
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (≥2.0 = positive) and 94 % for central 
      IHC versus central FISH. In the primary analysis, the association of HER2
      expression by 21-gene assay with trastuzumab benefit was marginally
      nonsignificant (nonlinear p = 0.057). In hormone receptor-positive patients
      (local IHC) the association was significant (p = 0.002). The association was
      nonlinear with the greatest estimated benefit at lower and higher HER2 expression
      levels. Conclusions: Concordance among HER2 assessments by central IHC, FISH, and
      RT-PCR were similar and high. Association of HER2 mRNA expression with
      trastuzumab benefit as measured by time to distant recurrence was nonsignificant.
      A consistent benefit of trastuzumab irrespective of mHER2 levels was observed in 
      patients with either IHC-positive or FISH-positive tumors. Trend for benefit was 
      observed also for the small groups of patients with negative results by any or
      all of the central assays. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00005970.

PG  - 2005-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies with the use of a prospective–retrospective design
      including archival tumor samples have shown that gene-expression assays provide
      clinically useful prognostic information. However, a prospectively conducted
      study in a uniformly treated population provides the highest level of evidence
      supporting the clinical validity and usefulness of a biomarker. METHODS: We
      performed a prospective trial involving women with hormone-receptor–positive,
      human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)–negative, axillary
      node–negative breast cancer with tumors of 1.1 to 5.0 cm in the greatest
      dimension (or 0.6 to 1.0 cm in the greatest dimension and intermediate or high
      tumor grade) who met established guidelines for the consideration of adjuvant
      chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features. A
      reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay of 21 genes was performed
      on the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, and the results were used to calculate a
      score indicating the risk of breast-cancer recurrence; patients were assigned to 
      receive endocrine therapy without chemotherapy if they had a recurrence score of 
      0 to 10, indicating a very low risk of recurrence (on a scale of 0 to 100, with
      higher scores indicating a greater risk of recurrence). RESULTS: Of the 10,253
      eligible women enrolled, 1626 women (15.9%) who had a recurrence score of 0 to 10
      were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone without chemotherapy. At 5
      years, in this patient population, the rate of invasive disease–free survival was
      93.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.4 to 94.9), the rate of freedom from
      recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99.6),
      the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant or
      local–regional site was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.9 to 99.2), and the rate of overall
      survival was 98.0% (95% CI, 97.1 to 98.6). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with
      hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative, axillary node–negative breast cancer
      who met established guidelines for the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy on
      the basis of clinicopathologic features, those with tumors that had a favorable
      gene-expression profile had very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with
      endocrine therapy alone. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others;

TI  - Treatment differences between urban and rural women with hormone
      receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer based on 21-gene assay recurrence
      score results.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - Background: Women who live in rural and urban settings have different outcomes
      for breast cancer. A 21-gene assay predicts 10-year distant recurrence risk and
      potential benefit of chemotherapy for women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) 
      breast cancer. Objective: To assess differences in scores and cancer therapies
      received by rural versus urban residence. Methods: We conducted a
      multi-institutional retrospective chart review of breast cancer patients
      diagnosed 2005-2010 with score results. Comparisons by rural versus urban
      residence (determined by rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes derived from zip
      codes) were made using the Fisher exact test for discrete data such as recurrence
      score results (<18 vs >18; score range, 0-100, with lower results correlated with
      less risk of distant recurrence), stage, and receptor status. The Wilcoxon rank
      sum test was used for continuous data (score results 0-100 and age.) All tests
      were at a 2-sided significance level of .05. Results: 504 patients had RUCA codes
      (92% white, 62% postmenopausal). For rural (n = 135) compared with urban (n =
      369) patients, the median scores were 16 and 18, respectively, P = .18. Most of
      the patients received endocrine therapy, 123 of 135 (91%) rural, compared with
      339 of 369 (92%) urban (P = .19). For scores 18-30, 20 of 56 (36%) rural
      patients, compared with 82 of 159 (52%) urban patients received chemotherapy (P =
      .03). Limitations: Limitations include lack of randomization to receipt of the
      assay. Conclusions: Recurrence score results did not significantly differ between
      women based on residence, although women living in a rural area received
      significantly less chemotherapy for scores >18. This suggests that for
      HR-positive breast cancer, discrepancies between rural and urban residence are
      driven by treatment factors rather than differences in biology. Funding: Genomic

TI  - A Validated Model for Identifying Patients Unlikely to Benefit From the 21-Gene
      Recurrence Score Assay.
PG  - 467-72
AB  - Predicting recurrence risk and chemotherapy benefit in early-stage breast cancer 
      is challenging. The Oncotype DX gene assay is often used. Using a database of 221
      patients a simple 2-rule model was developed and validated on an independent
      group of 319 patients. The model categorizes patients unlikely to benefit from
      the test thus achieving significant avoidance of cost.Background: Predicting
      recurrence risk and chemotherapy benefit in early-stage breast cancer can be
      challenging, and Oncotype DX (ODX) is often used to gain insight. However, it is 
      still unclear whether ODX can benefit in all cases. To clarify ODX’s usefulness
      we sought to develop a model using readily available pathologic markers to help
      clinicians make that determination. Patients and Methods: Clinical pathologic
      data from 221 hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer
      patients was used to create a model. The model was then validated on a second
      institution’s set of 319 patients. Results: The model has 2 simple rules: low
      grade and positive progesterone receptor tumors (LG+PR) are low risk, and high
      grade or low estrogen receptor (ER) (ER < 20%) tumors (HG/LER) are high risk. The
      TAILORx (Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (Rx)) trial
      thresholds of Recurrence Score (RS) ≤ 10, when chemotherapy is of little benefit,
      and RS ≥ 26 when chemotherapy might be beneficial were used to judge model
      performance. Impressively, the misclassifications of an HG/LER patient who has an
      RS ≤ 10 were 0% and 2%, and for LG+PR patients who had an RS ≥ 26 were 0% and
      2.6%. In the validation set, 28% (66 of 232) of the indeterminate group (neither 
      in the HG/LER nor the LG + PR groups) had an RS ≤ 10 or an RS ≥ 26; this group
      might clinically benefit from ODX. Conclusion: A simple 2-rule model based on
      readily available pathologic data was developed and validated, which categorized 
      patients into high and low risk for recurrence. Identification of patients who
      are unlikely to benefit from ODX testing could result in significant cost
      avoidance.

TI  - A Retrospective Study of the Impact of 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay on
      Treatment Choice in Node Positive Micrometastatic Breast Cancer.
PG  - 107-22
AB  - To assess clinical utility of the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score®),
      we determined whether women with HER2(−)/ER+ pN1mi breast cancer with low (<18)
      Recurrence Scores results are given adjuvant chemotherapy in a lower proportion
      than those with high scores (≥31). This was a multicenter chart review of ≥18
      year old women with pN1mi breast cancer, HER2(−)/ER+ tumors, ductal/lobular/mixed
      histology, with the assay ordered on or after 1 January 2007. One hundred and
      eighty one patients had a mean age of 60.7 years; 82.9% had ECOG performance
      status 0; 33.7% had hypertension, 22.7% had osteoporosis, 18.8% had
      osteoarthritis, and 8.8% had type-2 diabetes. Mean Recurrence Score was 17.8
      (range: 0–50). 48.6% had a mastectomy; 55.8% had a lumpectomy. 19.8% of low-risk 
      group patients were recommended chemotherapy vs. 57.9% in the intermediate-risk
      group and 100% in the high-risk group (p < 0.001). A total of 80.2% of the
      low-risk group were recommended endocrine therapy alone, while 77.8% of the
      high-risk group were recommended both endocrine and chemotherapy (p < 0.001). The
      Oncotype DX Recurrence Score result provides actionable information that can be
      incorporated into treatment planning for women with HER2(−)/ER+ pN1mi breast
      cancer. The Recurrence Score result has clinical utility in treatment planning
      for HER2(−)/ER+ pN1mi breast cancer patients.

TI  - The 21-gene recurrence score complements IBTR! Estimates in early-stage, hormone 
      receptor-positive, HER2-normal, lymph node-negative breast cancer.
LID - 36
AB  - Clinicians have traditionally used clinicopathological (CP) factors to determine 
      locoregional recurrence (LR) risk of breast cancer and have generated the IBTR!
      nomogram to predict the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). The
      21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay was recently correlated with LR in
      retrospective studies. The objective of this study was to examine the
      relationship between the RS and IBTR!. CP characteristics of 308 consecutive
      patients who underwent RS testing at our institution were examined. IBTR! was
      used to estimate the risk of 10-year IBTR. Descriptive statistics were used to
      compare the RS with the estimated IBTR!. Given a low event rate in this cohort,
      actual IBTR rates were not reported. Most patients had stage I/II (98%) and grade
      I/II (77%) disease. Median age was 54 years (range, 30–78). Median IBTR! without 
      radiation therapy was 10% (mean, 12% [range, 4-43%]). RS was low (<18),
      intermediate (18–30), and high (>30) in 52% (n = 160), 40% (n = 123), and 8%
      (n = 25) patients. Overall, IBTR! did not correlate with RS (P = .77). We saw no 
      correlation between RS and IBTR! in patients with less than (P = .32) or greater 
      than (P = .48) a 10% risk of IBTR. Interestingly, Ki-67 expression correlated
      with both IBTR! (P = .019) and the RS (P = .002). Further study is warranted to
      determine if the RS can provide complementary biological information to CP
      factors in estimating the risk of LR. Prospective studies evaluating this
      association may potentially allow for individualized treatment
      decisions.Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this article

TI  - The 21-Gene Recurrence Score and Locoregional Recurrence in Breast Cancer
      Patients.
PG  - 1088-94
AB  - Purpose: Although the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay has been validated to
      assess the risk of distant recurrence in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer 
      patients, the relationship between RS and the risk of locoregional recurrence
      (LRR) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine if RS is
      associated with LRR in breast cancer patients and whether this relationship
      varies based on the type of local treatment [mastectomy or breast-conserving
      therapy (BCT)]. Methods: 163 consecutive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
      patients at our institution had an RS generated from the primary breast tumor
      between August 2006 and October 2009. Patients were treated with lumpectomy and
      radiation (BCT) (n = 110) or mastectomy alone (n = 53). Patients were stratified 
      using a pre-determined RS of 25 and then grouped according to local therapy type.
      Results: Median follow-up was 68.2 months. Patients who developed an LRR had
      stage I or IIA disease, >2 mm surgical margins, and received chemotherapy as
      directed by RS. While an RS > 25 did not predict for a higher rate of LRR, an RS 
      > 24 was associated with LRR in our subjects. Among mastectomy patients, the
      5-year LRR rate was 27.3 % in patients with an RS > 24 versus 10.7 % (p = 0.04)
      in those whose RS was ≤24. RS was not associated with LRR in patients who
      received BCT. Conclusions: Breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy for
      tumors that have an RS > 24 are at high risk of LRR and may benefit from
      post-mastectomy radiation.

TI  - Association of a transcription factor 21 gene polymorphism with hypertension.
PG  - 118-22
AB  - Various loci and genes that confer susceptibility to coronary artery disease
      (CAD) have been identified mainly in Caucasian populations by genome-wide
      association studies (GWASs). As hypertension is a major risk factor for CAD,
      certain polymorphisms may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to CAD through
      affecting the predisposition to hypertension. The aim of the present study was to
      examine a possible association of hypertension with 29 single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) previously identified by meta-analyses of GWASs as
      susceptibility loci for CAD. Study subjects comprised of 5,460 individuals (3,348
      subjects with hypertension and 2,112 controls). The genotypes of SNPs were
      determined by the multiplex bead-based Luminex assay. The χ2 test revealed that
      genotype distributions and allele frequencies for rs12190287 of the transcription
      factor 21 gene (TCF21) and rs1122608 of the SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated,
      actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4 gene (SMARCA4) were
      significantly (P<0.05) associated with hypertension. Allele frequencies for
      rs9369640 of the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1) and genotype
      distributions for rs599839 of the proline/serine-rich coiled-coil 1 gene (PSRC1) 
      were also significantly associated with hypertension. Multivariable logistic
      regression analysis with adjustment for age, gender, body mass index and smoking 
      status revealed that rs12190287 of TCF21 (P=0.0014; recessive model; odds ratio, 
      1.21) was significantly associated with hypertension, and the C allele
      represented a risk factor for this condition. Similar analyses revealed that
      rs1122608 of SMARCA4 (P=0.0305; dominant model; odds ratio, 0.86), rs9369640 of
      PHACTR1 (P=0.0119; dominant model; odds ratio, 0.82) and rs599839 of PSRC1
      (P=0.0248; dominant model; odds ratio, 0.84) were also related to hypertension,
      with the minor T, C and G alleles, respectively, being protective against this
      condition. Thus, the present results indicate that rs12190287 (G→C) of TCF21 is a
      susceptibility locus for hypertension.

TI  - The Clinical Impact of 21-Gene Recurrence Score on Treatment Decisions for
      Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer in Korea.
PG  - 208-14
AB  - Purpose: The 21-gene (Oncotype DX) recurrence score (RS) assay is useful in
      predicting the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer patients
      and is widely used in Western countries. However, to date, it has not gained much
      popularity in East Asia. We analyzed the results from five institutions’
      experience from using the 21-gene assay and examined the impact of assay results 
      on decision making of chemotherapy in Korean breast cancer patients and the
      associations between RS and clinicopathologic characteristics. Materials and
      Methods: The 21-gene assay was performed on 212 patients with estrogen
      receptor-positive early breast cancer in five institutions. Each center made
      systemic treatment decisions both before and after the knowledge of assay
      results. Results: Among the 212 patients, 132 (62.3%) had a low RS of < 18, 60
      (28.3%) had an intermediate RS of 18-30, and 20 (9.4%) had a high RS of ≥ 31.
      Histologic grade, presence of micrometastases, Ki-67, and presence of lymphatic
      invasion were statistically associated with the RS results. Treatment decisions
      were changed in 115 of 212 patients (54.2%) in 109 of 212 (51.4%) from
      chemotherapy plus hormone therapy to hormone therapy, and in six of 212 (2.8%)
      from hormone therapy to chemotherapy plus hormone therapy. Conclusion: The
      21-gene breast cancer assay proved to have a significant impact on treatment
      decision- making. The test reduces chemotherapy use in more than 50% of Korean
      estrogen receptor-positive, early breast cancer patients.

TI  - Societal cost-effectiveness analysis of the 21-gene assay in
      estrogen-receptor–positive, lymph-node–negative early-stage breast cancer in
      Japan.
LID - 372
AB  - Background: Breast-cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing in Japan. 
      Japanese-specific clinical validity and utility data for the 21-gene assay
      (Oncotype DX® Breast Cancer Assay; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, USA) are
      now available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
      of the 21-gene assay for the guidance of adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in
      estrogen-receptor–positive, lymph-node–negative, early-stage breast cancer
      patients, from the Japanese societal perspective. Methods: The recurrence risk
      group distribution by the 21-gene assay result and the assay’s influence on
      adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations were obtained from a study of 104 patients.
      A state-transition cohort (Markov) model tracked time from surgery until distant 
      recurrence and from distant recurrence to death. Adjuvant chemotherapy benefit by
      21-gene assay risk group was based on published clinical validation studies.
      Direct and indirect medical costs were obtained from the referral centers.
      Utilities associated with progression and chemotherapy-related adverse events
      were extracted from literature. Sensitivity analyses assessed the key drivers and
      robustness of the primary outcomes. Results: The 21-gene assay identified 48% of 
      patients as low-risk, 36% as intermediate-risk, and 16% as high-risk. Total acute
      chemotherapy-related costs decreased by ¥154,066 due to less adjuvant
      chemotherapy usage. In the high-risk group, adjuvant chemotherapy use increased
      18%, leading to survival benefits. Chemotherapy use overall decreased by 19%.
      Monitoring costs increased by ¥3,744 but recurrence costs declined by ¥46,113 per
      patient. Use of the 21-gene assay increased quality-adjusted–life-years (QALYs)
      by 0.241 per patient on average; the net cost per QALY gained was ¥636,752
      ($6,368). Conclusions: The 21-gene assay for women with
      estrogen-receptor–positive, lymph-node–negative, early-stage breast cancer is
      projected to be cost-effective in Japan.

TI  - Predictive and Prognostic Value of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score in Hormone
      Receptor–positive, Node-positive Breast Cancer.
PG  - 404-10
AB  - The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to hormonal therapy is recommended for
      patients with estrogen receptor–positive (ER+), node-positive (N+) early breast
      cancer (EBC). Some of these patients, however, are not likely to benefit from
      treatment and may, therefore, be overtreated while also incurring unnecessary
      treatment-related adverse events and health care costs. The 21-gene Recurrence
      Score assay has been clinically validated and recommended for use in patients
      with ER+, node-negative (N0) EBC to assess the 10-year risk of distant disease
      recurrence and predict the likelihood of response to adjuvant chemotherapy. A
      growing body of evidence from several large phase III clinical trials reports
      similar findings in patients with ER+, N+ EBC. A systematic review of published
      literature from key clinical trials that have used the 21-gene breast cancer
      assay in patients with ER+, N+ EBC was performed. The Recurrence Score has been
      shown to be an independent predictor of disease-free survival, overall survival, 
      and distant recurrence-free interval in patients with ER+, N+ EBC. Outcomes from 
      decision impact and health economics studies further indicate that the Recurrence
      Score affects physician treatment recommendations equally in patients with N+ or 
      N0 disease. It also indicates that a reduction in Recurrence Score–directed
      chemotherapy is cost-effective. There is a large body of evidence to support the 
      use of the 21-gene assay Recurrence Score in patients with N+ EBC. Use of this
      assay could help guide treatment decisions for patients who are most likely to
      receive benefit from chemotherapy.

TI  - Prognostic Discrimination Using a 70-Gene Signature among Patients with Estrogen 
      Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer and an Intermediate 21-Gene Recurrence Score.
PG  - 23685-99
AB  - The Oncotype DX® recurrence score (RS) predictor has been clinically utilized to 
      appropriately select adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive early breast cancer. However, the selection of chemotherapy for
      patients with intermediate RSs remains controversial. We assessed the prognostic 
      value of a 70-gene signature (70GS) among patients with ER-positive breast cancer
      and intermediate RSs. In addition, we sought to identify genes associated with
      poor 70GS scores based on gene expression profiling (GEP). GEP was performed
      using gene expression data from 186 patients with ER-positive breast cancer. The 
      RS and 70GS score were calculated on the basis of GEP. Among 186 patients, 82
      ER-positive patients with intermediate RSs were identified. These patients were
      stratified by 70GS, overall survival (OS) significantly differed according to
      70GS (p = 0.013). In a supervised hierarchical analysis according to 70GS, the
      expression of several representative genes for cell proliferation was
      significantly higher in the poor 70GS cluster than in the good 70GS cluster.
      Furthermore, among these patients, FOXM1, AURKA, AURKB, and BIRC5 displayed
      prognostic significance for OS. In conclusion, 70GS can help to discriminate
      survival differences among ER-positive patients with intermediate RSs. FOXM1,
      AURKA, AURKB, and BIRC5, are associated with poor 70GS scores.

TI  - The impact of the 21-gene Recurrence Score assay on clinical decision-making in
      node-positive (up to 3 positive nodes) estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
      patients.
PG  - 83-92
AB  - Oncotype DX testing is reimbursed in Israel for node-negative and node-positive
      (N1+; up to 3 positive nodes including micrometastases), estrogen receptor
      positive (ER+), breast cancer patients. This retrospective study evaluated the
      impact of Oncotype DX testing on treatment decisions in N1+/ER+ breast cancer
      patients. To this end, we compared treatments for all N+ patients for whom
      testing had been ordered with treatments for patients with similar
      characteristics where the test had not been available. The retrospective analysis
      included 951 patients (282 Oncotype DX, 669 controls), all of whom received
      endocrine therapy with or without chemotherapy. In Oncotype DX patients, 7.1,
      37.0, and 100 % of those with low, intermediate, and high Recurrence Score
      results (Oncotype DX summary score) received chemotherapy, respectively
      (P < 0.0001, all comparisons). Chemotherapy use was lower in Oncotype DX patients
      versus controls (24.5 vs. 70.1 %). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis
      in which the probability of receiving chemotherapy was modeled as a function of
      Oncotype DX testing, age, tumor size, tumor grade, nodal status, and the
      interactions between Oncotype DX testing and the other covariates, Oncotype DX
      testing was associated with significantly lower odds of receiving chemotherapy
      (odds ratio 0.16; 95 % CI 0.11–0.24; P < 0.0001). In summary, our findings
      suggest that Oncotype DX testing has a significant impact on reducing
      chemotherapy use in N1+/ER+ breast cancer patients in Israel.

TI  - The 21-gene recurrence score assay impacts adjuvant therapy recommendations for
      ER-positive, node-negative and node-positive early breast cancer resulting in a
      risk-adapted change in chemotherapy use.
PG  - 618-24
AB  - Background: We carried out a prospective clinical study to evaluate the impact of
      the Recurrence Score (RS) on treatment decisions in early breast cancer (EBC).
      Patients and methods: A total of 379 eligible women with estrogen receptor
      positive (ER+), HER2-negative EBC and 0–3 positive lymph nodes were enrolled.
      Treatment recommendations, patients' decisional conflict, physicians' confidence 
      before and after knowledge of the RS and actual treatment data were recorded.
      Results: Of the 366 assessable patients 244 were node negative (N0) and 122 node 
      positive (N+). Treatment recommendations changed in 33% of all patients (N0 30%, 
      N+ 39%). In 38% of all patients (N0 39%, N+ 37%) with an initial recommendation
      for chemoendocrine therapy, the post-RS recommendation changed to endocrine
      therapy, in 25% (N0 22%, N+ 39%) with an initial recommendation for endocrine
      therapy only to combined chemoendocrine therapy, respectively. A patients'
      decisional conflict score improved by 6% (P = 0.028) and physicians' confidence
      increased in 45% (P < 0.001) of all cases. Overall, 33% (N0 29%, N+ 38%) of fewer
      patients actually received chemotherapy as compared with patients recommended
      chemotherapy pre-test. Using the test was cost-saving versus current clinical
      practice. Conclusion: RS-guided chemotherapy decision-making resulted in a
      substantial modification of adjuvant chemotherapy usage in node-negative and
      node-positive ER+ EBC.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of a 21-gene recurrence score assay versus Canadian clinical
      practice in women with early-stage estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive,
      axillary lymph-node negative breast cancer.
PG  - 447
AB  - Background: A 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay may inform adjuvant systematic 
      treatment decisions in women with early stage breast cancer. We sought to
      investigate the cost effectiveness of using the RS-assay versus current clinical 
      practice (CCP) in women with early-stage estrogen- or
      progesterone-receptor-positive, axilliary lymph-node negative breast cancer (ER+/
      PR + LN- ESBC) from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system.
      Methods: We developed a Markov model to project the lifetime clinical and
      economic consequences of ESBC. We evaluated adjuvant therapy separately in post- 
      and pre-menopausal women with ER+/ PR + LN- ESBC. We assumed that the RS-assay
      would reclassify pre- and post-menopausal women among risk levels (low,
      intermediate and high) and guide adjuvant systematic treatment decisions. The
      model was parameterized using 7 year follow up data from the Manitoba Cancer
      Registry, cost data from Manitoba administrative databases, and secondary
      sources. Costs are presented in 2010 CAD. Future costs and benefits were
      discounted at 5%. Results: The RS-assay compared to CCP generated cost-savings in
      pre-menopausal women and had an ICER of $60,000 per QALY gained in
      post-menopausal women. The cost effectiveness was most sensitive to the
      proportion of women classified as intermediate risk by the RS-assay who receive
      adjuvant chemotherapy and the risk of relapse in the RS-assay model. Conclusions:
      The RS-assay is likely to be cost effective in the Canadian healthcare system and
      should be considered for adoption in women with ER+/ PR + LN- ESBC. However,
      ongoing assessment and validation of the assay in real-world clinical practice is
      warranted.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay in the Context of
      Multifactorial Decision Making to Guide Chemotherapy for Early-Stage Breast
      Cancer.
PG  - 203-11
AB  - Purpose: New evidence is available regarding the utility of the 21-gene
      Recurrence Score (RS) assay in guiding chemotherapy use for node-negative,
      estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. We applied this evidence in a
      decision-analytic model to reevaluate the cost-effectiveness of the assay.
      Methods: We cross-classified patients by clinicopathologic characteristics from
      the Adjuvant! risk index and by RS risk group. For non–RS-guided treatment, we
      assumed patients receiving hormonal therapy alone had low-risk characteristics
      and patients receiving chemotherapy and hormonal therapy had higher-risk
      characteristics. For RS-guided treatment, we assigned chemotherapy probabilities 
      conditional on RS risk group and clinicopathologic characteristics. Results: An
      estimated 40.4% of patients in the RS-guided strategy and 47.3% in the
      non–RS-guided strategy were expected to receive chemotherapy. The incremental
      gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.28) with 
      the RS-guided strategy. Lifetime medical costs to the health system were $2692
      ($1546 to $3821) higher with the RS-guided strategy, for an incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio of $16,677/QALY ($7613 to $37,219). From a societal
      perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness was $10,788/QALY ($6840 to
      $30,265). Conclusion: The findings provide supportive evidence for the economic
      value of the 21-gene RS assay in node-negative, estrogen receptor–positive breast
      cancer.

TI  - Psychosocial and Quality of Life in Women Receiving the 21-Gene Recurrence Score 
      Assay: The Impact of Decision Style in Women with Intermediate RS.
LID - 728290
AB  - Multigene assays such as the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) quantify risk for
      recurrence and potential benefit from chemotherapy in early-stage, ER+ breast
      cancers. Few studies have assessed the impact of testing on patient-reported
      outcomes such as cancer-related distress or quality of life. The few studies that
      have assessed these outcomes do not consider potential modifiers, such as the
      patients' level of involvement in the treatment decision-making process. In the
      current study, 81 breast cancer patients who received the RS assay completed
      cross-sectional surveys. We used linear multiple regression to assess whether
      test result, decision-making role (passive versus shared/active), and their
      interaction contributed to current levels of distress, quality of life, and
      decisional conflict. There were no associations between these variables and test 
      result or decision-making role. However, women who received an intermediate RS
      and took a passive role in their care reported higher-cancer-related distress and
      cancer worry and lower quality of life than those who took a shared or active
      role. These data should be confirmed in prospective samples, as these poorer
      outcomes could be amenable to intervention.

TI  - Prognostic value of biologic subtype and the 21-gene recurrence score relative to
      local recurrence after breast conservation treatment with radiation for early
      stage breast carcinoma: results from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E2197
      study.
PG  - 683-92
AB  - The present study was performed to evaluate the significance of biologic subtype 
      and 21-gene recurrence score relative to local recurrence and local–regional
      recurrence after breast conservation treatment with radiation. Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group E2197 was a prospective randomized clinical trial that
      compared two adjuvant systemic chemotherapy regimens for patients with operable
      breast carcinoma with 1–3 positive lymph nodes or negative lymph nodes with tumor
      size >1.0 cm. The study population was a subset of 388 patients with known
      21-gene recurrence score and treated with breast conservation surgery, systemic
      chemotherapy, and definitive radiation treatment. Median follow-up was 9.7 years 
      (range = 3.7–11.6 years). The 10-year rates of local recurrence and
      local–regional recurrence were 5.4 % and 6.6 %, respectively. Neither biologic
      subtype nor 21-gene Recurrence Score was associated with local recurrence or
      local–regional recurrence on univariate or multivariate analyses (all P ≥ 0.12). 
      The 10-year rates of local recurrence were 4.9 % for hormone receptor positive,
      HER2-negative tumors, 6.0 % for triple negative tumors, and 6.4 % for
      HER2-positive tumors (P = 0.76), and the 10-year rates of local–regional
      recurrence were 6.3, 6.9, and 7.2 %, respectively (P = 0.79). For hormone
      receptor positive tumors, the 10-year rates of local recurrence were 3.2, 2.9,
      and 10.1 % for low, intermediate, and high 21-gene recurrence score, respectively
      (P = 0.17), and the 10-year rates of local–regional recurrence were 3.8, 5.1, and
      12.0 %, respectively (P = 0.12). For hormone receptor- positive tumors, the
      21-gene recurrence score evaluated as a continuous variable was significant for
      local–regional recurrence (hazard ratio 2.66; P = 0.03). The 10-year rates of
      local recurrence and local–regional recurrence were reasonably low in all subsets
      of patients. Neither biologic subtype nor 21-gene recurrence score should
      preclude breast conservation treatment with radiation.

TI  - Macronutrient choice of BTBR.NZW mice congenic for a 21-gene region of chromosome
      17.
PG  - 556-61
AB  - There has been scant work to investigate the mechanisms influencing macronutrient
      selection by mice. Here, we measured the consumption and choice of carbohydrate- 
      and fat-containing diets by NZW/LacJ (NZW) and BTBR/T+ tf/J (BTBR) strains. We
      found that NZW mice voluntarily ate more carbohydrate and less fat than did BTBR 
      mice. Mice with a BTBR background and a heterozygous (BTBR/NZW) congenic region
      on chromosome 17 between 25.7 – 27.5 Mb (N10 generation) or 26.7 – 27.5 Mb (N12
      generation) also ate more carbohydrate and less fat than did homozygous
      (BTBR/BTBR) littermate controls. Of the 21 known and predicted genes in the
      congenic interval between 26.7 – 27.5 Mb, we raise for consideration as a
      causative candidate Itpr3, the inositol triphosphate receptor type 3 gene, which 
      is a component of the GPCR-mediated taste transduction cascade. We speculate that
      a mutation in Itpr3 influences food choice by impairing the detection of
      nutrients in the macronutrient-containing diets.

AB  - Risk assignment in breast cancer patients using the PAM50 Breast Cancer Intrinsic
      Classifier™ and the Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score in the same population was
      compared. There is good agreement between the two assays for high and low
      prognostic risk assignment but PAM50 assigns more patients to the low risk
      category. About half of the intermediate risk RS group was reclassified as low
      risk luminal A by PAM50, which suggests a potential complementary use for the
      assays.

      Score Assay and Adjuvant! for Women with Node-Negative, ER-Positive Breast
      Cancer: Results from NSABP B-14 and NSABP B-20.
PG  - 133-42
AB  - The Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score® (RS) is a validated genomic predictor of
      outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer.
      Adjuvant! was developed using SEER registry data and results from the Early
      Breast Cancer Clinical Trialists’ overview analyses to estimate outcome and
      benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. In this report we
      compare the prognostic and predictive utility of these two tools in
      node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer. RS and Adjuvant! results were available
      from 668 tamoxifen-treated NSABP B-14 patients: 227 tamoxifen-treated NSABP B-20 
      patients, and 424 chemotherapy-plus-tamoxifen-treated B-20 patients. Adjuvant!
      results were also available from 1952 B-20 patients. The primary endpoint was
      distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). Cox proportional hazards models were
      used to compare the prognostic and predictive utility of RS and Adjuvant!. Both
      RS (p<0.001) and Adjuvant! (p=0.002) provided strong independent prognostic
      information in tamoxifen-treated patients. Combining RS and individual
      clinicopathologic characteristics provided greater prognostic discrimination than
      combining RS and the composite Adjuvant!. In the B-20 cohort with RS results
      (n=651), RS was significantly predictive of chemotherapy benefit (interaction
      p=0.031 for DRFI, p=0.011 for overall survival [OS], p=0.082 for disease-free
      survival [DFS]), but Adjuvant! was not (interaction p=0.99, p=0.311 and p=0.357, 
      respectively). However, in the larger B-20 sub-cohort (n=1952), Adjuvant! was
      significantly predictive of chemotherapy benefit for OS (interaction p=0.009) but
      not for DRFI (p=0.219) or DFS (p=0.099). Prognostic estimates can be optimized by
      combining RS and clinicopathologic information instead of simply combining RS and
      Adjuvant!. RS should be used for estimating relative chemotherapy benefit.

TI  - Functional analysis and identification of cis-regulatory elements of human
      chromosome 21 gene promoters.
PG  - 6112-23
AB  - Given the inherent limitations of in silico studies relying solely on DNA
      sequence analysis, the functional characterization of mammalian promoters and
      associated cis-regulatory elements requires experimental support, which demands
      cloning and analysis of putative promoter regions. Focusing on human chromosome
      21, we cloned 182 gene promoters of 2500 bp in length and conducted reporter gene
      assays on transfected-cell arrays. We found 56 promoters that were active in
      HEK293 cells, while another 49 promoters could be activated by treatment of cells
      with Trichostatin A or depletion of serum. We observed high correlations between 
      promoter activities and endogenous transcript levels, RNA polymerase II
      occupancy, CpG islands and core promoter elements. Truncation of a subset of 62
      promoters to ∼500 bp revealed that truncation rarely resulted in loss of
      activity, but rather in loss of responses to external stimuli, suggesting the
      presence of cis-regulatory response elements within distal promoter regions. In
      these regions, we found a strong enrichment of transcription factor binding sites
      that could potentially activate gene expression in the presence of stimuli. This 
      study illustrates the modular functional architecture of chromosome 21 promoters 
      and helps to reveal the complex mechanisms governing transcriptional regulation.

TI  - Association Between the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay and Risk of Locoregional
      Recurrence in Node-Negative, Estrogen Receptor–Positive Breast Cancer: Results
      From NSABP B-14 and NSABP B-20.
PG  - 1677-83
AB  - Purpose: The 21-gene OncotypeDX recurrence score (RS) assay quantifies the risk
      of distant recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with node-negative, estrogen 
      receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer. We investigated the association between RS 
      and risk for locoregional recurrence (LRR) in patients with node-negative,
      ER-positive breast cancer from two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
      Project (NSABP) trials (NSABP B-14 and B-20). Patients and Methods: RS was
      available for 895 tamoxifen-treated patients (from both trials), 355
      placebo-treated patients (from B-14), and 424 chemotherapy plus tamoxifen-treated
      patients (from B-20). The primary end point was time to first LRR. Distant
      metastases, second primary cancers, and deaths before LRR were censored. Results:
      In tamoxifen-treated patients, LRR was significantly associated with RS risk
      groups (P < .001). The 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of LRR was 4.% (95% CI, 2.3%
      to 6.3%) for patients with a low RS (< 18), 7.2% (95% CI, 3.4% to 11.0%) for
      those with intermediate RS (18-30), and 15.8% (95% CI, 10.4% to 21.2%) for those 
      with a high RS (> 30). There were also significant associations between RS and
      LRR in placebo-treated patients from B-14 (P = .022) and in chemotherapy plus
      tamoxifen–treated patients from B-20 (P = .028). In multivariate analysis, RS was
      an independent significant predictor of LRR along with age and type of initial
      treatment. Conclusion: Similar to the association between RS and risk for distant
      recurrence, a significant association exists between RS and risk for LRR. This
      information has biologic consequences and potential clinical implications
      relative to locoregional therapy decisions for patients with node-negative and
      ER-positive breast cancer.

TI  - Prognostic and Predictive Value of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay in a
      Randomized Trial of Chemotherapy for Postmenopausal, Node-Positive, Estrogen
      Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.
PG  - 55-65
AB  - Background: The 21-gene Recurrence Score assay (RS) is prognostic for women with 
      node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer (BC) treated with
      tamoxifen. A low RS predicts little benefit of chemotherapy. For node-positive
      BC, we investigated whether RS was prognostic in women treated with tamoxifen
      alone and whether it identified those who might not benefit from
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy, despite higher recurrence risks. Methods: The
      phase III trial S8814 for postmenopausal women with node-positive, ER-positive BC
      showed that CAF chemotherapy prior to tamoxifen (CAF-T) added survival benefit to
      tamoxifen alone. Optional tumor banking yielded specimens for RS determination by
      RT-PCR. We evaluated the effect of RS on disease-free survival (DFS) by treatment
      group (tamoxifen versus CAF-T) using Cox regression adjusting for number of
      positive nodes. Findings: There were 367 specimens (40% of parent trial) with
      sufficient RNA (tamoxifen, 148; CAF-T, 219). The RS was prognostic in the
      tamoxifen arm (p=0.006). There was no CAF benefit in the low RS group (logrank
      p=0.97; HR=1.02, 95% CI (0.54,1.93)), but major DFS improvement for the high RS
      subset (logrank p=.03; HR=0.59, 95% CI (0.35, 1.01)), adjusting for number of
      positive nodes. The RS-by-treatment interaction was significant in the first 5
      years (p=0.029), with no additional prediction beyond 5 years (p=0.58), though
      the cumulative benefit remained at 10 years. Results were similar for overall
      survival and BC-specific survival. Interpretation: In this retrospective
      analysis, the RS is prognostic for tamoxifen-treated patients with positive nodes
      and predicts significant CAF benefit in tumors with a high RS. A low RS
      identifies women who may not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy
      despite positive nodes.

TI  - DNA Methylation Analysis of Chromosome 21 Gene Promoters at Single Base Pair and 
      Single Allele Resolution.
LID - e1000438
AB  - Differential DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic signal for gene
      regulation, development, and disease processes. We mapped DNA methylation
      patterns of 190 gene promoter regions on chromosome 21 using bisulfite conversion
      and subclone sequencing in five human cell types. A total of 28,626 subclones
      were sequenced at high accuracy using (long-read) Sanger sequencing resulting in 
      the measurement of the DNA methylation state of 580427 CpG sites. Our results
      show that average DNA methylation levels are distributed bimodally with
      enrichment of highly methylated and unmethylated sequences, both for amplicons
      and individual subclones, which represent single alleles from individual cells.
      Within CpG-rich sequences, DNA methylation was found to be anti-correlated with
      CpG dinucleotide density and GC content, and methylated CpGs are more likely to
      be flanked by AT-rich sequences. We observed over-representation of CpG sites in 
      distances of 9, 18, and 27 bps in highly methylated amplicons. However, DNA
      sequence alone is not sufficient to predict an amplicon's DNA methylation status,
      since 43% of all amplicons are differentially methylated between the cell types
      studied here. DNA methylation in promoter regions is strongly correlated with the
      absence of gene expression and low levels of activating epigenetic marks like
      H3K4 methylation and H3K9 and K14 acetylation. Utilizing the single base pair and
      single allele resolution of our data, we found that i) amplicons from different
      parts of a CpG island frequently differ in their DNA methylation level, ii)
      methylation levels of individual cells in one tissue are very similar, and iii)
      methylation patterns follow a relaxed site-specific distribution. Furthermore,
      iv) we identified three cases of allele-specific DNA methylation on chromosome
      21. Our data shed new light on the nature of methylation patterns in human cells,
      the sequence dependence of DNA methylation, and its function as epigenetic signal
      in gene regulation. Further, we illustrate genotype–epigenotype interactions by
      showing novel examples of allele-specific methylation.

TI  - Prognostic Utility of the 21-Gene Assay in Hormone Receptor–Positive Operable
      Breast Cancer Compared With Classical Clinicopathologic Features.
PG  - 4063-71
AB  - Purpose: Adjuvant! is a standardized validated decision aid that projects
      outcomes in operable breast cancer based on classical clinicopathologic features 
      and therapy. Genomic classifiers offer the potential to more accurately identify 
      individuals who benefit from chemotherapy than clinicopathologic features.
      Patients and Methods: A sample of 465 patients with hormone receptor (HR)
      –positive breast cancer with zero to three positive axillary nodes who did (n =
      99) or did not have recurrence after chemohormonal therapy had tumor tissue
      evaluated using a 21-gene assay. Histologic grade and HR expression were
      evaluated locally and in a central laboratory. Results: Recurrence Score (RS) was
      a highly significant predictor of recurrence, including node-negative and
      node-positive disease (P < .001 for both) and when adjusted for other clinical
      variables. RS also predicted recurrence more accurately than clinical variables
      when integrated by an algorithm modeled after Adjuvant! that was adjusted to
      5-year outcomes. The 5-year recurrence rate was only 5% or less for the estimated
      46% of patients who have a low RS (< 18). Conclusion: The 21-gene assay was a
      more accurate predictor of relapse than standard clinical features for individual
      patients with HR-positive operable breast cancer treated with chemohormonal
      therapy and provides information that is complementary to features typically used
      in anatomic staging, such as tumor size and lymph node involvement. The 21-gene
      assay may be used to select low-risk patients for abbreviated chemotherapy
      regimens similar to those used in our study or high-risk patients for more
      aggressive regimens or clinical trials evaluating novel treatments.

TI  - Classification of Human Chromosome 21 Gene-Expression Variations in Down
      Syndrome: Impact on Disease Phenotypes.
PG  - 475-91
AB  - Down syndrome caused by chromosome 21 trisomy is the most common genetic cause of
      mental retardation in humans. Disruption of the phenotype is thought to be the
      result of gene-dosage imbalance. Variations in chromosome 21 gene expression in
      Down syndrome were analyzed in lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients and
      control individuals. Of the 359 genes and predictions displayed on a specifically
      designed high-content chromosome 21 microarray, one-third were expressed in
      lymphoblastoid cells. We performed a mixed-model analysis of variance to find
      genes that are differentially expressed in Down syndrome independent of sex and
      interindividual variations. In addition, we identified genes with variations
      between Down syndrome and control samples that were significantly different from 
      the gene-dosage effect (1.5). Microarray data were validated by quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction. We found that 29% of the expressed chromosome 21
      transcripts are overexpressed in Down syndrome and correspond to either genes or 
      open reading frames. Among these, 22% are increased proportional to the
      gene-dosage effect, and 7% are amplified. The other 71% of expressed sequences
      are either compensated (56%, with a large proportion of predicted genes and
      antisense transcripts) or highly variable among individuals (15%). Thus, most of 
      the chromosome 21 transcripts are compensated for the gene-dosage effect.
      Overexpressed genes are likely to be involved in the Down syndrome phenotype, in 
      contrast to the compensated genes. Highly variable genes could account for
      phenotypic variations observed in patients. Finally, we show that alternative
      transcripts belonging to the same gene are similarly regulated in Down syndrome
      but sense and antisense transcripts are not.
