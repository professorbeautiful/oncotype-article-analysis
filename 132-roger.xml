Further markers of recurrence include disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow (BM) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood, particularly stemness-like tumor cells (slCTCs). In this study, Oncotype DX, DTCs, CTCs and slCTCs were used to evaluate the risk of recurrence in 68 patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, early-stage breast cancer. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were analyzed for the expression of 16 cancer genes and 5 reference genes by Oncotype DX, yielding a recurrence score (RS). G2 tumors were evaluated for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI1) and Ki-67. Two BM aspirates were analyzed by immunocytochemistry for DTCs using the pan-cytokeratin antibody A45-B/B3. CTCs and slCTCs in the blood were detected using the AdnaTest BreastCancer, AdnaTest EMT and the AdnaTest TumorStemCell. Oncotype DX was performed in 68 cases, yielding a low RS in 30/68 patients (44%), an intermediate RS in 29/68 patients (43%) and a high RS in 9/68 patients (13%). DTCs were detected in 19/68 patients (28%), CTCs in 13/68 patients (19%) and slCTCs in 26/68 (38%) patients. Moreover, 8/68 patients (12%) with G2 tumors were positive for uPA, 6/68 (9%) for PAI1 and 21/68 (31%) for Ki-67. Ki-67, progesterone receptor (PR) and G3 tumors were significantly correlated with RS (P&lt;0.001; P=0.006; and P=0,002, respectively), whereas no correlation was identified between DTCs, CTCs, slCTCs and RS. Ki-67 may support therapeutic decisions in cases where Oncotype DX is not feasible. Larger patient cohorts are required to estimate the additional detection of DTCs and CTCs for the determination of risk recurrence.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albain, Kathy S</author><author>Barlow, William E</author><author>Shak, Steven</author><author>Hortobagyi, Gabriel N</author><author>Livingston, Robert B</author><author>Yeh, I.-Tien I-Tien Tien</author><author>Ravdin, Peter</author><author>Bugarini, Roberto</author><author>Baehner, Frederick L</author><author>Davidson, Nancy E</author><author>Sledge, George W</author><author>Winer, Eric P</author><author>Hudis, Clifford</author><author>Ingle, James N</author><author>Perez, Edith a</author><author>Pritchard, Kathleen I</author><author>Shepherd, Lois</author><author>Gralow, Julie R</author><author>Yoshizawa, Carlo</author><author>Allred, D Craig</author><author>Osborne, C Kent</author><author>Hayes, Daniel F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prognostic and predictive value of the 21-gene recurrence score assay in postmenopausal women with node-positive, oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer on chemotherapy: a retrospective analysis of a randomised trial</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>55-65</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols: th</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biological: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: chemistry</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: mortality</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: secondary</keyword><keyword>Clinical Trials</keyword><keyword>Cyclophosphamide</keyword><keyword>Cyclophosphamide: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Disease-Free Survival</keyword><keyword>Doxorubicin</keyword><keyword>Doxorubicin: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Estrogen</keyword><keyword>Estrogen: analysis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing</keyword><keyword>Genetic Testing: methods</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Kaplan-Meier Estimate</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Patient Selection</keyword><keyword>Phase III as Topic</keyword><keyword>Postmenopause</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Proportional Hazards Models</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword><keyword>Tumor Markers</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>United States: epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1474-5488 (Electronic)\r1470-2045 (Linking)</isbn><accession-num>20005174</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70314-6</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Albain et al. - 2010 - Prognostic and predictive value of the 21-gene recurrence score assay in postmenopausal women with node-positi(3).pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Albain et al. - 2010 - Prognostic and predictive value of the 21-gene recurrence score assay in postmenopausal women with node-positi(4).pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://nihms227230.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3058239/</url><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470204509703146</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3058239&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;em-disease free survival;em-hazard ratio;fpb-focus-patient benefit from chemo;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;interesting;pmc99;rogerjob;tissue-past;tos-RCT;tos-cohort;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: The 21-gene recurrence score assay is prognostic for women with node-negative, oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen. A low recurrence score predicts little benefit of chemotherapy. For node-positive breast cancer, we investigated whether the recurrence score was prognostic in women treated with tamoxifen alone and whether it identified those who might not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy, despite higher risks of recurrence. METHODS: The phase 3 trial SWOG-8814 for postmenopausal women with node-positive, oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer showed that chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) before tamoxifen (CAF-T) added survival benefit to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Optional tumour banking yielded specimens for determination of recurrence score by RT-PCR. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed the effect of recurrence score on disease-free survival by treatment group (tamoxifen vs CAF-T) using Cox regression, adjusting for number of positive nodes. FINDINGS: There were 367 specimens (40% of the 927 patients in the tamoxifen and CAF-T groups) with sufficient RNA for analysis (tamoxifen, n=148; CAF-T, n=219). The recurrence score was prognostic in the tamoxifen-alone group (p=0.006; hazard ratio [HR] 2.64, 95% CI 1.33-5.27, for a 50-point difference in recurrence score). There was no benefit of CAF in patients with a low recurrence score (score &lt;18; log-rank p=0.97; HR 1.02, 0.54-1.93), but an improvement in disease-free survival for those with a high recurrence score (score &gt; or =31; log-rank p=0.033; HR 0.59, 0.35-1.01), after adjustment for number of positive nodes. The recurrence score by treatment interaction was significant in the first 5 years (p=0.029), with no additional prediction beyond 5 years (p=0.58), although the cumulative benefit remained at 10 years. Results were similar for overall survival and breast-cancer-specific survival. INTERPRETATION: The recurrence score is prognostic for tamoxifen-treated patients with positive nodes and predicts significant benefit of CAF in tumours with a high recurrence score. A low recurrence score identifies women who might not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy, despite positive nodes.

A 21-gene assay predicts 10-year distant recurrence risk and potential benefit of chemotherapy for women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. Objective: To assess differences in scores and cancer therapies received by rural versus urban residence. Methods: We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective chart review of breast cancer patients diagnosed 2005-2010 with score results. Comparisons by rural versus urban residence (determined by rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) codes derived from zip codes) were made using the Fisher exact test for discrete data such as recurrence score results (18; score range, 0-100, with lower results correlated with less risk of distant recurrence), stage, and receptor status. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for continuous data (score results 0-100 and age.) All tests were at a 2-sided significance level of .05. Results: 504 patients had RUCA codes (92% white, 62% postmenopausal). For rural (n = 135) compared with urban (n = 369) patients, the median scores were 16 and 18, respectively, P = .18. Most of the patients received endocrine therapy, 123 of 135 (91%) rural, compared with 339 of 369 (92%) urban (P = .19). For scores 18-30, 20 of 56 (36%) rural patients, compared with 82 of 159 (52%) urban patients received chemotherapy (P = .03). Limitations: Limitations include lack of randomization to receipt of the assay. Conclusions: Recurrence score results did not significantly differ between women based on residence, although women living in a rural area received significantly less chemotherapy for scores &gt;18.

Molecular tests such as the 21 gene expression test (Oncotype DXTM) and 70 gene microarray test (MammaPrint®) have revolutionized the predictive and prognostic tools in the clinic. By stratifying the risk of recurrence for patients, the tests are able to provide clinicians with more information on the treatment outcomes of using chemotherapy, HER2 targeted therapy or endocrine therapy or the combination of the therapies for patients with particular genetic expressions. However, it is still questionable for clinical applications as some areas remain unclear and that the true benefit still needs prospective evaluation. Such studies are under way and are anxiously awaited. In this paper, the limitation of the molecular tests are discussed. As we are moving towards personalized medicine, molecular profiling will not only result in better outcomes but in a certain proportion of patients, likely will spare unnecessary use of cytotoxic compounds and reduce the cost to the health care systems.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arranz, Enrique Espinosa</author><author>Vara, Juan Ángel Fresno</author><author>Gámez-Pozo, Angelo</author><author>Zamora, Pilar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene signatures in breast cancer: current and future uses.</title><secondary-title>Translational oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Translational oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>398-403</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1936-5233</isbn><accession-num>23323153</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23323153</url><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=PMC3542834</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;pmc99;tos-overview</label><abstract>Gene signatures have been developed for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer to complement pathological factors in providing prognostic information.

Our objectives were to □ estimate the proportion of such patients for whom proliferative indices [mitotic count (mc), Ki-67 immunostain, and Oncotype dx (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA, U.S.A.) recurrence score (rs)] were obtained.□ compare the indices preferred by oncologists with the indices available to them.□ correlate Nottingham grade (ng) and its subcomponents with Oncotype dx.□ assess interobserver variation. Methods: All of the er-positive, her2-negative, T1–2, N0 breast cancers diagnosed from 2007 to 2011 (n = 5110) were linked to a dataset of all provincial breast cancers with a rs. A 5% random sample of the 5110 cancers was reviewed to estimate the proportion that had a mc, Ki-67 index, and rs. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the rs with ng subcomponent scores. Interobserver variation in histologic grading between outside and central review pathology reports was assessed using a weighted kappa test. Results: During 2007–2011, most cancers were histologically graded and assigned a mc; few had a Ki-67 index or rs. The ng and mc were significantly positively correlated with rs. The level of agreement in histologic scoring between outside and central pathology reports was good or very good. Very few cases with a low mc had a high rs (1.8%). Conclusions: Patients with low ng and mc scores are unlikely to have a high rs, and thus are less likely to benefit from chemotherapy. In the context of limited resources, that finding can guide clinicians about when a rs adds the most value.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berg, AO</author><author>Armstrong, K</author><author>Botkin, J</author><author>Calonge, N</author><author>Haddow, J</author><author>Haye, s M</author><author>Kaye C, Phillips KA, Piper M, Richards, CS</author><author>Scott, JA</author><author>Strickland, OL</author><author>Teutsch, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recommendations from the EGAPP Working Group: can tumor gene expression profiling improve outcomes in patients with breast cancer?</title><secondary-title>Genetics in Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetics in Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>66-73</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>1098-3600 1530-0366</isbn><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19125125</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpc-focus-patient confidence;notrelevant;pmc99</label><abstract>Summary of Recommendations: The EGAPP Working Group (EWG) found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the use of tumor gene expression profiles to improve outcomes in defined populations of women with breast cancer. For one test, the EWG found preliminary evidence of potential benefit of testing results to some women who face decisions about treatment options (reduced adverse events due to low risk women avoiding chemotherapy), but could not rule out the potential for harm for others (breast cancer recurrence that might have been prevented). The evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the proposed uses of the tests. The EWG encourages further development and evaluation of these technologies. Rationale: The measurement of gene expression in breast tumor tissue is proposed as a way to estimate the risk of distant disease recurrence in order to provide additional information beyond current clinicopathological risk stratification and to influence decisions about treatment in order to improve health outcomes.

We sought to assess whether the standard genomic report provided to doctors is a good approach for communicating results to patients. Methods: During 2009–2010, we interviewed 133 patients with stages I or II, node-negative, hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and eligible for the Oncotype DX genomic test. In a randomized experiment, patients viewed 6 vignettes that presented hypothetical recurrence risk test results. Each vignette described a low, intermediate, or high chance of breast cancer recurrence in 10 years. Vignettes used one of five risk formats of increasing complexity that we derived from the standard report that accompanies the commercial assay or a sixth format that used an icon array. Results: Among women who received the genomic recurrence risk test, 63% said their doctors showed them the standard report. The standard report format yielded among the most errors in identification of whether a result was low, intermediate or high risk (i.e., the gist of the results), while a newly developed risk continuum format yielded the fewest errors (17% vs. 5%; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.52). For high-recurrence risk results presented in the standard format, women made errors 35% of the time. Women rated the standard report as one of the least understandable and least liked formats, but they rated the risk continuum format as among the most understandable and most liked. Results differed little by health literacy, numeracy, prior receipt of genomic test results during clinical care and actual genomic test results. Conclusion: The standard genomic recurrence risk report was more difficult for women to understand and interpret than other formats. A less complex report, potentially including the risk continuum format, would be more effective in communicating test results to patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brufsky, Adam M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predictive and Prognostic Value of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score in Hormone Receptor–positive, Node-positive Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>404-410</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0277-3732 1537-453X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/COC.0000000000000086</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ovid- Predictive and Prognostic Value of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score in Hormone Receptor-positive, Node-positive Breast Cancer..pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00000421-201408000-00016</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;em-disease free survival;pmc99;pts-node-pos ER+;tos-overview</label><abstract>The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to hormonal therapy is recommended for patients with estrogen receptor–positive (ER+), node-positive (N+) early breast cancer (EBC). Some of these patients, however, are not likely to benefit from treatment and may, therefore, be overtreated while also incurring unnecessary treatment-related adverse events and health care costs. The 21-gene Recurrence Score assay has been clinically validated and recommended for use in patients with ER+, node-negative (N0) EBC to assess the 10-year risk of distant disease recurrence and predict the likelihood of response to adjuvant chemotherapy. A growing body of evidence from several large phase III clinical trials reports similar findings in patients with ER+, N+ EBC. A systematic review of published literature from key clinical trials that have used the 21-gene breast cancer assay in patients with ER+, N+ EBC was performed. The Recurrence Score has been shown to be an independent predictor of disease-free survival, overall survival, and distant recurrence-free interval in patients with ER+, N+ EBC. Outcomes from decision impact and health economics studies further indicate that the Recurrence Score affects physician treatment recommendations equally in patients with N+ or N0 disease. It also indicates that a reduction in Recurrence Score–directed chemotherapy is cost-effective. There is a large body of evidence to support the use of the 21-gene assay Recurrence Score in patients with N+ EBC. Use of this assay could help guide treatment decisions for patients who are most likely to receive benefit from chemotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buchanan, James</author><author>Wordsworth, Sarah</author><author>Schuh, Anna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Issues surrounding the health economic evaluation of genomic technologies.</title><secondary-title>Pharmacogenomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmacogenomics</full-title></periodical><pages>1833-47</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>benefit ana</keyword><keyword>cost</keyword><keyword>costs</keyword><keyword>cost–benefit analysis</keyword><keyword>cost–effectiveness analysis</keyword><keyword>economic</keyword><keyword>economic evaluation</keyword><keyword>effectiveness</keyword><keyword>effectiveness ana</keyword><keyword>evaluation n effectiveness n</keyword><keyword>extra-welfarism</keyword><keyword>extra-welfarism n genetics n</keyword><keyword>genetics</keyword><keyword>genomics</keyword><keyword>genomics n outcomes</keyword><keyword>lysis n cost</keyword><keyword>lysis n costs n</keyword><keyword>outcomes</keyword><keyword>review</keyword><keyword>welfarism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>10.2217/pgs.13.183</isbn><accession-num>24236483</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2217/pgs.13.183</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24236483</url></web-urls></urls><label>JULIA;Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;done;economic focus;fe-focus-economic;tos-validation</label><abstract>AIM: Genomic interventions could enable improved disease stratification and individually tailored therapies. However, they have had a limited impact on clinical practice to date due to a lack of evidence, particularly economic evidence. This is partly because health economists are yet to reach consensus on whether existing methods are sufficient to evaluate genomic technologies. As different approaches may produce conflicting adoption decisions, clarification is urgently required. This article summarizes the methodological issues associated with conducting economic evaluations of genomic interventions. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: A structured literature review was conducted to identify references that considered the methodological challenges faced when conducting economic evaluations of genomic interventions. RESULTS: Methodological challenges related to the analytical approach included the choice of comparator, perspective and timeframe. Challenges in costing centered around the need to collect a broad range of costs, frequently, in a data-limited environment. Measuring outcomes is problematic as standard measures have limited applicability, however, alternative metrics (e.g., personal utility) are underdeveloped and alternative approaches (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) underused. Effectiveness data quality is weak and challenging to incorporate into standard economic analyses, while little is known about patient and clinician behavior in this context. Comprehensive value of information analyses are likely to be helpful. CONCLUSION: Economic evaluations of genomic technologies present a particular challenge for health economists. New methods may be required to resolve these issues, but the evidence to justify alternative approaches is yet to be produced. This should be the focus of future work in this field.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carlson, Josh J.</author><author>Roth, Joshua a.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of the Oncotype Dx breast cancer assay in clinical practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</full-title></periodical><pages>13-22</pages><volume>141</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Adjuvant chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>Breast cancer</keyword><keyword>Gene expression</keyword><keyword>Meta-analysis</keyword><keyword>done</keyword><keyword>pts-node-neg ER+</keyword><keyword>tos-overview</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0167-6806 1573-7217</isbn><accession-num>23974828</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10549-013-2666-z</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Carlson, Roth - 2013 - The impact of the Oncotype Dx breast cancer assay in clinical practice A systematic review and meta-analysis(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10549-013-2666-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+PR+;tos-overview</label><abstract>The impact of the Oncotype Dx (ODX) breast cancer assay on adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) treatment decisions has been evaluated in many previous studies. However, it can be difficult to interpret the collective findings, which were conducted in diverse settings with limited sample sizes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the results and provide insights about ODX utility. Studies, identified from PubMed, Embase, ASCO, and SABCS, were included if patients had ER+, node –, early-stage breast cancer, reported use of ODX to inform actual ACT decisions. Information was summarized and pooled according to: (1) distribution of ODX recurrence scores (RS), (2) impact of ODX on ACT recommendations, (3) impact of ODX on ACT use, and (4) proportion of patients following the treatment suggested by the ODX RS. A total of 23 studies met inclusion criteria. The distribution of RS categories was 48.8 % low, 39.0 % intermediate, and 12.2 % high (21 studies, 4,156 patients). ODX changed the clinical-pathological ACT recommendation in 33.4 % of patients (8 studies, 1,437 patients). In patients receiving ODX, receipt of ACT were: 28.2 % overall, 5.8 % low, 37.4 % intermediate, and 83.4 % high. High RS patients were significantly more likely to follow the treatment suggested by ODX versus low RS patients RR: 1.07 (1.01–1.14). The pooled results are consistent with most individual studies to date. The increased proportion of intermediate scores relative to original estimates may have implications for the clinical utility and cost impacts of testing. In addition, low versus high RS patients were significantly more likely to follow the ODX results, suggesting a tendency toward less aggressive treatment, despite a high ODX RS. Finally, there was a lack of studies on the impact of ODX on ACT use versus standard approaches, suggesting that additional studies are warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carlson, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>NCCN Task force report: Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer - Clarification and expansion of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines</title><secondary-title>Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16507275</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16507275</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;JULIA;Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;notrelevant;unsure</label><abstract>Abstract The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) first published the NCCN Breast Cancer Treatment Guidelines in 1996. The Guidelines address the treatment of all stages of breast cancer across the spectrum of patient care and have been updated yearly. Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer has undergone an especially rapid evolution over the past few years. Therefore, the NCCN Breast Cancer Guidelines Panel was supplemented by additional experts to form the Adjuvant Therapy Task Force to provide a forum for an extended discussion and expanded input to the adjuvant therapy recommendations for the Breast Cancer Treatment Guidelines. Issues discussed included methods of risk-stratification for recurrence; how biologic markers such as HER2 status, quantitative estrogen receptor, or genetic markers can be incorporated as prognostic or predictive factors; and how age, menopausal status, and estrogen receptor levels impact benefits from chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. Additionally, the task force discussed the strategies for use of aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women and the potential incorporation of trastuzumab into adjuvant therapy of women with HER2/neu positive breast cancer. This supplement summarizes the background data and ensuing discussion from the Adjuvant Task Force meeting.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chae, Eun Young</author><author>Moon, Woo Kyung</author><author>Kim, Hak Hee</author><author>Kim, Won Hwa</author><author>Cha, Joo Hee</author><author>Shin, Hee Jung</author><author>Choi, Woo Jung</author><author>Han, Wonshik</author><author>Noh, Dong-Young</author><author>Lee, Sae Byul</author><author>Ahn, Sei Hyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association between Ultrasound Features and the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assays in Patients with Oestrogen Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative, Invasive Breast Cancer.</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e0158461</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0158461</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://journal.pone.0158461.PDF</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158461</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;fl-focus-laboratory;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+HER2-;tos-cohort</label><abstract>A multigene expression assay corresponds to the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence after the initial diagnosis and can be used to guide the decision for additional chemotherapy. However, only few studies have investigated the associations between the imaging features of breast cancer and the results of multigene expression assays. Our study was to identify the relationship between imaging features on ultrasound (US) and the recurrence score (RS) on a 21-gene expression assay in patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. 267 patients with ER-positive, HER-negative invasive breast cancer who underwent examinations using US and Oncotype DX assay were included. US images were independently reviewed by dedicated breast radiologists who were blind to the RS. Tumour roundness was measured using a laboratory-developed software program. The pathological data were reviewed, including immunohistochemistry results. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the associations between the RS and each variable. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of high RS. Of 267 patients, 147 (55%) had low, 96 (36%) intermediate, and 24 (9%) had high RS. According to the univariate analysis, parallel orientation, presence of calcification in the mass, and tumour roundness were positively associated with high RS. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that parallel orientation (OR = 5.53) and tumour roundness (OR = 1.70 per 10 increase) were associated with high RS. Parallel orientation and tumour roundness are independent variables that may predict high RS in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Clara</author><author>Dhanda, Rahul</author><author>Tseng, W.-Y.</author><author>Forsyth, Michael</author><author>Patt, Debra A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating Use Characteristics for the Oncotype Dx 21-Gene Recurrence Score and Concordance With Chemotherapy Use in Early-Stage Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>182-187</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1554-7477 1935-469X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JOP.2012.000638</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jop.ascopubs.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JOP.2012.000638</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpb-focus-patient benefit from chemo;fpb-focus-patient benefit from oncotype;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Patients who are younger, have better ECOG performance status, or have higher grade tumors are more likely to undergo recurrence score testing.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheung, P Sy</author><author>Tong, A C</author><author>Leung, R Cy</author><author>Kwan, W H</author><author>Yau, T Cc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Initial experience with the Oncotype DX assay in decision-making for adjuvant therapy of early oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in Hong Kong.</title><secondary-title>Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi / Hong Kong Academy of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi / Hong Kong Academy of Medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24948666</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.12809/hkmj134140</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24948666</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;OncotypeDX_EM;doctor focus;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pts-node-neg ER+</label><abstract>OBJECTIVE. To examine the impact of the 21-gene Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay on the adjuvant treatment decision-making process for early-stage breast cancer in Hong Kong. DESIGN. Retrospective study. SETTING. Private hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS. Study included cases of early-stage breast cancer (T1-2N0-1M0, oestrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative) that were presented at a multidisciplinary breast meeting at a single site. Cases were selected for Oncotype DX testing with the assistance of Adjuvant! Online. The recommendations for adjuvant therapy before and after obtaining the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score results were analysed. RESULTS. A total of 154 cases that met the inclusion criteria were discussed at our multidisciplinary breast meeting. Of these, 64 cases with no clear recommendation by the Meeting Panel were selected for this study and reviewed. The distribution of Recurrence Score results was similar to that reported by others, with a somewhat higher proportion of low Recurrence Scores. Treatment recommendation was changed for 20 (31%) patients after the Oncotype DX result was received. Of the changes in treatment decisions, 16 (80%) were changes to lower-intensity regimens (either equipoise or hormonal therapy). The number of cases receiving an equipoise recommendation decreased by nine (82%), based on the additional information provided by the Oncotype DX test. CONCLUSION. The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score information impacts the decision-making process for adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer in the multidisciplinary care setting in Hong Kong. A larger-scale study is required to gain more experience, evaluate its impact more thoroughly, and assess its cost-effectiveness.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clark-Langone, Kim M</author><author>Sangli, Chithra</author><author>Krishnakumar, Jayadevi</author><author>Watson, Drew</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Translating tumor biology into personalized treatment planning: analytical performance characteristics of the Oncotype DX®Colon Cancer Assay</title><secondary-title>BMC Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>691</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1471-2407</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2407-10-691</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-10-691</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;notrelevant;pmc13</label><abstract>Background: The Oncotype DX® Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity, multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using pre-determined performance criteria, which is a critical component of molecular diagnostic test validation. Results: All analytical measurements met pre-specified performance criteria. PCR amplification efficiency for all 12 assays was high, ranging from 96% to 107%, while linearity was demonstrated over an 11 log2 concentration range for all assays. Based on estimated components of variance for FPE RNA pools, analytical reproducibility and precision demonstrated low SDs for individual genes (0.16 to 0.32 CTs), gene groups (≤0.05 normalized/aggregate CTs) and RS (≤1.38 RS units). Conclusions: Analytical performance characteristics shown here for both individual genes and gene groups in the Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay demonstrate consistent translation of specific biology of individual tumors into clinically useful diagnostic information.

Recently, Landemaine and colleagues described a six-gene signature purported to predict lung metastasis risk. They analyzed gene expression in 23 metastases from breast cancer patients (5 lung, 18 non-lung) identifying a 21-gene signature. Expression of 16 of these was analyzed in primary breast tumors from 72 patients with known outcome, and six were selected that were predictive of lung metastases: DSC2, TFCP2L1, UGT8, ITGB8, ANP32E, and FERMT1. Despite the value of such a signature, our analysis indicates that this analysis ignored potentially important confounding factors and that their signature is instead a surrogate for molecular subtype.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeFrank, J.T.</author><author>Salz, Talya</author><author>Reeder-Hayes, Katherine</author><author>Brewer, N.T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Who Gets Genomic Testing for Breast Cancer Recurrence Risk?</title><secondary-title>Public Health Genomics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Public Health Genomics</full-title></periodical><pages>215-222</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1662-4246 1662-8063</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000353518</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.karger.com?doi=10.1159/000353518</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpc-focus-patient confidence;pmc99;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Background/Aims: Our study examined whether patient characteristics, beliefs, and decision-making styles were associated with uptake of genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk. Methods: Participants were 132 early-stage breast cancer patients eligible for the Oncotype DX genomic test. We interviewed patients in 2009–2010 and obtained information from medical charts. Results: Half of women eligible for genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk received it. The most common reason for not getting the test was that women’s physicians did not offer it (80%). Test recipients were more likely to be unsure about receiving chemotherapy treatment compared to women who did not receive the test (p&lt;.05). Women who received the test had less advanced disease pathologies, recalled a lower objective recurrence risk, perceived lower recurrence risk and were slightly younger (all p&lt;.05). Most women who described their decision-making style as active received the test (75%) whereas few women who described their style as passive received the test (12%) (p&lt;.01). Conclusion: In the university clinic we studied, genomic testing appeared to more common among patients who may benefit most from the information provided by results, but confirmation in larger studies is needed.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eiermann, W</author><author>Rezai, M</author><author>Kummel, S.</author><author>Kuhn, T.</author><author>Warm, M</author><author>Friedrichs, K</author><author>Schneeweiss, A</author><author>Markmann, S</author><author>Eggemann, H</author><author>Hilfrich, J</author><author>Jackisch, C</author><author>Witzel, I</author><author>Eidtmann, H</author><author>Bachinger, A</author><author>Hell, S</author><author>Blohmer, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 21-gene recurrence score assay impacts adjuvant therapy recommendations for ER-positive, node-negative and node-positive early breast cancer resulting in a risk-adapted change in chemotherapy use</title><secondary-title>Annals of Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>618-624</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0923-7534 1569-8041</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/annonc/mds512</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1093/annonc/mds512</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fdc-focus-doctor confidence;fe-focus-economic;fpc-focus-patient confidence;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tos-prospective</label><abstract>Background: We carried out a prospective clinical study to evaluate the impact of the Recurrence Score (RS) on treatment decisions in early breast cancer (EBC). Patients and methods: A total of 379 eligible women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), HER2-negative EBC and 0–3 positive lymph nodes were enrolled. Treatment recommendations, patients' decisional conflict, physicians' confidence before and after knowledge of the RS and actual treatment data were recorded. Results: Of the 366 assessable patients 244 were node negative (N0) and 122 node positive (N+). Treatment recommendations changed in 33% of all patients (N0 30%, N+ 39%). In 38% of all patients (N0 39%, N+ 37%) with an initial recommendation for chemoendocrine therapy, the post-RS recommendation changed to endocrine therapy, in 25% (N0 22%, N+ 39%) with an initial recommendation for endocrine therapy only to combined chemoendocrine therapy, respectively. A patients' decisional conflict score improved by 6% (P = 0.028) and physicians' confidence increased in 45% (P &lt; 0.001) of all cases. Overall, 33% (N0 29%, N+ 38%) of fewer patients actually received chemotherapy as compared with patients recommended chemotherapy pre-test. Using the test was cost-saving versus current clinical practice. Conclusion: RS-guided chemotherapy decision-making resulted in a substantial modification of adjuvant chemotherapy usage in node-negative and node-positive ER+ EBC.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ellis, P.

In this pilot study, we investigated the possible correlation of miRNAs with risk of recurrence of estrogen receptor positive, lymph node-negative mammary carcinomas as determined by the Oncotype DX® Breast Cancer assay. To accomplish this, we extracted RNA from a collection of breast carcinomas that had previously been analyzed by Oncotype DX®. Multiple Let-7 family members were negatively correlated with the recurrence score (RS), which is consistent with their tumor suppressor properties. Additional miRNAs were found to positively correlate with RS, including miR-377-5p, miR-633b, miR-548t and miR-3648. Pathway analysis of putative and validated targets suggests that these miRNAs may have a diverse range of functions that may contribute to tumor recurrence. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that a miRNA expression signature can be developed to aid existing methods to determine the risk of recurrence for women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancers treated with endocrine therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fiets, Willem E</author><author>Nortier, Johan WR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multigene RT-PCR assay used to predict recurrence in early breast cancer: two presentations with contradictory results</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>185</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><isbn>1465-5411 1465-542X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/bcr911</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr911</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;em-risk of recurrence;interesting;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tos-overview;tos-retrospective;tos-validation</label><abstract>During the 2003 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium two studies were presented that were designed to validate a recurrence score, derived from a 21-gene RT-PCR assay, in patients with axillary node-negative breast cancer.

This was a multicenter chart review of ≥18 year old women with pN1mi breast cancer, HER2(−)/ER+ tumors, ductal/lobular/mixed histology, with the assay ordered on or after 1 January 2007. One hundred and eighty one patients had a mean age of 60.7 years; 82.9% had ECOG performance status 0; 33.7% had hypertension, 22.7% had osteoporosis, 18.8% had osteoarthritis, and 8.8% had type-2 diabetes. Mean Recurrence Score was 17.8 (range: 0–50). 48.6% had a mastectomy; 55.8% had a lumpectomy. 19.8% of low-risk group patients were recommended chemotherapy vs. 57.9% in the intermediate-risk group and 100% in the high-risk group (p &lt; 0.001). A total of 80.2% of the low-risk group were recommended endocrine therapy alone, while 77.8% of the high-risk group were recommended both endocrine and chemotherapy (p &lt; 0.001).

Of the 111 patients included in the analysis, 78 (70.3%) had hormonal therapy (HT) and 33 (29.7%) had chemohormonal therapy (CHT) recommendations pre-testing. The Recurrence Score was significantly higher in those with a pre-testing CHT recommendation compared with those with a pre-testing HT recommendation (median of 24 vs. 22; P = 0.047; Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon [MWW] test). Post-testing, treatment of 24 patients (21.6%) was different from their pre-testing recommendation. The difference between CHT recommendation rate pre-testing and the rate of CHT received post-testing was nonsignificant for the entire cohort and for patients’ subgroups (by age, tumor size, and grade) (P &gt;0.17; McNemar’s test). Following classification of the cohort into two Recurrence Score subcategories (low-intermediate, [18-25]; high-intermediate, [26-30]), changes in treatment decisions (pre-testing recommendations vs. actual treatments received post testing) were reported for 16.5% of low-intermediate and 34.4% of high-intermediate patients. Post-testing, the rate of CHT decreased (by 58%) in the low-intermediate subcategory and increased (by 64%) in the high-intermediate subcategory (P &lt;0.01, both subcategories). In logistic regression analyses, the Recurrence Score subcategory was the only significant predictor of changes in treatment decisions (pre-testing recommendations vs. actual treatments received post testing; P &lt;0.01). The only significant difference between the two subsets of patients with such a change (HT to CHT, 11 patients; CHT to HT, 13 patients) was the Recurrence Score (median of 28 vs. 20, respectively; P = 0.0014; MWW test).

However, it is still unclear whether ODX can benefit in all cases. To clarify ODX's usefulness we sought to develop a model using readily available pathologic markers to help clinicians make that determination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical pathologic data from 221 hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative invasive breast cancer patients was used to create a model. The model was then validated on a second institution's set of 319 patients. RESULTS: The model has 2 simple rules: low grade and positive progesterone receptor tumors (LG+PR) are low risk, and high grade or low estrogen receptor (ER) (ER &lt; 20%) tumors (HG/LER) are high risk. The TAILORx (Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (Rx)) trial thresholds of Recurrence Score (RS) ≤ 10, when chemotherapy is of little benefit, and RS ≥ 26 when chemotherapy might be beneficial were used to judge model performance. Impressively, the misclassifications of an HG/LER patient who has an RS ≤ 10 were 0% and 2%, and for LG+PR patients who had an RS ≥ 26 were 0% and 2.6%. In the validation set, 28% (66 of 232) of the indeterminate group (neither in the HG/LER nor the LG+PR groups) had an RS ≤ 10 or an RS ≥ 26; this group might clinically benefit from ODX. CONCLUSION: A simple 2-rule model based on readily available pathologic data was developed and validated, which categorized patients into high and low risk for recurrence. Identification of patients who are unlikely to benefit from ODX testing could result in significant cost avoidance.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gianni, Luca</author><author>Zambetti, Milvia</author><author>Clark, Kim</author><author>Baker, Joffre</author><author>Cronin, Maureen</author><author>Wu, Jenny</author><author>Mariani, Gabriella</author><author>Rodriguez, Jaime</author><author>Carcangiu, Marialuisa</author><author>Watson, Drew</author><author>Valagussa, Pinuccia</author><author>Rouzier, Roman</author><author>Symmans, W.

We also tested whether chemotherapy response is correlated with the 21-gene Recurrence Score assay that quantifies recurrence risk. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer received neoadjuvant paclitaxel and doxorubicin. RNA was extracted from the pretreatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded core biopsies. The expression of 384 genes was quantified using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and correlated with pathologic complete response (pCR). The performance of genes predicting for pCR was tested in patients from an independent neoadjuvant study where gene expression was obtained using DNA microarrays. RESULTS:Of 89 assessable patients (mean age, 49.9 years; mean tumor size, 6.4 cm), 11 (12%) had a pCR. Eighty-six genes correlated with pCR (unadjusted P &lt; .05); pCR was more likely with higher expression of proliferation-related genes and immune-related genes, and with lower expression of estrogen receptor (ER) -related genes. In 82 independent patients treated with neoadjuvant paclitaxel and doxorubicin, DNA microarray data were available for 79 of the 86 genes. In univariate analysis, 24 genes correlated with pCR with P &lt; .05 (false discovery, four genes) and 32 genes showed correlation with P &lt; .1 (false discovery, eight genes). The Recurrence Score was positively associated with the likelihood of pCR (P = .005), suggesting that the patients who are at greatest recurrence risk are more likely to have chemotherapy benefit. CONCLUSION: Quantitative expression of ER-related genes, proliferation genes, and immune-related genes are strong predictors of pCR in women with locally advanced breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant anthracyclines and paclitaxel.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giordano, Sharon H</author><author>Lin, Y.-L.</author><author>Kuo, Yong Fang</author><author>Hortobagyi, Gabriel N</author><author>Goodwin, James S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decline in the Use of Anthracyclines for Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>2232-2239</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>0732-183X 1527-7755</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JCO.2011.40.1273</electronic-resource-num><notes>&amp;quot;patients who underwent 21-gene recurrence score testing and those treated with trastuzumab were more likely to receive taxane-based chemotherapy&amp;quot; !!!!

Methods: Claims from a 5% national Medicare sample and from a nationally representative claims database (Marketscan) from 1998 to 2009 were used. Patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD), ninth revision, codes indicating breast cancer, ICD and Common Procedural Terminology codes indicating breast surgery, and claims for chemotherapy between 3 months before and 12 months after surgery comprised the study cohort. Chemotherapy was classified as anthracycline-based or taxane-based, and the percentages of use were calculated. Piecewise regression models were used to identify the inflection points in the rates of chemotherapy use. The effect of patient characteristics on receiving different types of chemotherapy was estimated by multivariable logistic regression models. Results: A total of 4,458 patients were included in the Medicare cohort and 30,422 in the private insurance cohort. After 2005, a sharp increase in the use of taxane-based chemotherapy and a decline in anthracycline-based chemotherapy was seen. By 2008 in the Medicare cohort, 51% of patients received taxane-based and 32% received anthracycline-based chemotherapy. By the end of 2008, the majority of patients younger than 65 years were also receiving taxane-based chemotherapy. Patients younger than 35 years were less likely to be treated with a taxane-based regimen, whereas patients who underwent 21-gene recurrence score testing and those treated with trastuzumab were more likely to receive taxane-based chemotherapy. Conclusion: The use of anthracycline-based chemotherapy has declined, and the majority of patients with breast cancer are instead receiving taxane-based chemotherapy. The potential impact on patient outcomes is unknown.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gligoriv, Joseph</author><author>Pivot, X.B.</author><author>Jacot, William</author><author>Nama, Herve L.</author><author>Spaieth, D.</author><author>Misset, J-L</author><author>Largillier, Remy</author><author>Sautier, J-L</author><author>de Roquancourt, Anne</author><author>Pomel, C</author><author>Rouaet, P</author><author>Rouzier, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prospective Clinical Utility Study of the Use of the 21-Gene Assay in Adjuvant Clinical Decision Making in Women With Estrogen Receptor-Positive Early Invasive Breast Cancer : Results From the SWITCH Study</title><secondary-title>The Oncologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Oncologist</full-title></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><volume>20</volume><keywords><keyword>adjuvant x chemotherapy x</keyword><keyword>done</keyword><keyword>early breast cancer x</keyword><keyword>fdc-focus-doctor confidence</keyword><keyword>pts-ER+</keyword><keyword>tos-prospective</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://The Oncologist-2015-Gligorov-theoncologist.2014-0467.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26112003</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;done;fdc-focus-doctor confidence;fpb-focus-patient benefit from oncotype;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pts-ER+;tos-prospective</label></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldstein, Lori J</author><author>Gray, Robert</author><author>Badve, Sunil</author><author>Childs, Barrett H</author><author>Yoshizawa, Carl</author><author>Rowley, Steve</author><author>Shak, Steven</author><author>Baehner, Frederick L</author><author>Ravdin, Peter M</author><author>Davidson, Nancy E</author><author>Sledge, George W</author><author>Perez, Edith A</author><author>Shulman, Lawrence N</author><author>Martino, Silvana</author><author>Sparano, Joseph A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prognostic Utility of the 21-Gene Assay in Hormone Receptor-Positive Operable Breast Cancer Compared With Classical Clinicopathologic Features</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>4063-4071</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>25</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><isbn>0732-183X 1527-7755</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JCO.2007.14.4501</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JCO.2007.14.4501</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;compare-Adjuvant!;em-5-year recurrence rate;pmc99</label><abstract>Purpose: Adjuvant! is a standardized validated decision aid that projects outcomes in operable breast cancer based on classical clinicopathologic features and therapy.

These tests have been validated in multiple retrospective studies, and prospective clinical trials are in progress. The TAILORx trial uses the Oncotype DX recurrence score to assign estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), node-negative patients to chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy versus hormonal therapy alone. The RxPONDER (SWOG S1007) trial uses Oncotype DX in a similar approach but on node-positive patients, and it includes the PAM50 test as a secondary analysis. The MINDACT trial uses Mamma-Print and Adjuvant! Online for treatment arm assignments. MINDACT has very broad eligibility criteria and 2 secondary randomizations for selecting chemotherapy and hormonal therapy regimens. This article discusses how the latest results on cancer genome sequencing apply to early-stage breast cancer. Several hundred breast cancers have already undergone genome sequencing, and the somatic DNA changes found in the tumor, compared with the patient's normal DNA, have been identified. Higher rates of point mutations and chromosomal translocations are found in aromatase inhibitor-resistant ER+ cancers and in the basal-like and HER2-enriched breast cancer subtypes. Correlations of somatic mutations with neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor response are discussed. Genome sequencing can potentially identify the molecular abnormalities that underlie the poor risk identified by multigene tests and provide potential new targets for therapy, but more clinical trials correlating clinical outcome and somatic DNA changes are needed.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guth, Amber A</author><author>Fineberg, Susan</author><author>Fei, Kezhen</author><author>Franco, Rebeca</author><author>Bickell, Nina A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Utilization of Oncotype DX in an Inner City Population: Race or Place?</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Breast Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Breast Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1-3</pages><volume>2013</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1155/2013/653805</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijbc/2013/653805/</url></web-urls></urls><label>OncotypeDX_EM;done;economic focus;fe-focus-economic;notrelevant</label><abstract>Oncotype DX, a 21-gene-array analysis, can guide chemotherapy treatment decisions for women with ER+ tumors. Of 225 ER+ women participating in a patient assistance trial, 23% underwent Oncotype DX testing: 31% of whites, 21% of blacks, and 14% of Hispanics ( P = 0.04 ) were tested. Only 3 white women were treated at municipal hospitals and none was tested. 3% of women treated in municipal hospital as compared to 30% treated at tertiary referral centers were tested ( P = 0.001 ). Within tertiary referral centers, there was no racial difference in testing: 32% of whites, 29% of blacks, and 19% of Hispanics ( P = 0.25 ). Multivariate analysis (model c-statistic = 0.76; P &lt; 0.0001 ) revealed that women who underwent testing were more likely to have stage 1B ( RR = 1.70 ; 95% CI: 1.45–1.85) and to be treated after 2007 ( RR = 1.34 ; 95% CI: 1.01–1.65) and less likely to be treated at a municipal hospital ( RR = 0.20 ; 95% CI: 0.04–0.94). Women treated at municipal hospitals were less likely to undergo testing resulting in a misleading racial disparity that is driven by site of care. As Oncotype DX can reduce overuse of chemotherapy, it is imperative to expand testing to those who could benefit from yet experience underuse of this test, namely, women treated at safety net hospitals.

The tests primarily rely on quantification of ER and proliferation-related genes and combine these into multivariate prediction models. Since ER-negative cancers tend to have higher proliferation rates, the prognostic value of current multigene tests in these cancers is limited. First-generation prognostic signatures (Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Genomic Grade Index) are substantially more accurate to predict recurrence within the first 5 years than in later years. This has become a limitation with the availability of effective extended adjuvant endocrine therapies. Newer tests (Prosigna, EndoPredict, Breast Cancer Index) appear to possess better prognostic value for late recurrences while also remaining predictive of early relapse. Some clinical prediction problems are more difficult to solve than others: there are no clinically useful prognostic signatures for ER-negative cancers, and drug-specific treatment response predictors also remain elusive. Emerging areas of research involve the development of immune gene signatures that carry modest but significant prognostic value independent of proliferation and ER status and represent candidate predictive markers for immune-targeted therapies. Overall metrics of tumor heterogeneity and genome integrity (for example, homologue recombination deficiency score) are emerging as potential new predictive markers for platinum agents. The recent expansion of high-throughput technology platforms including low-cost sequencing of circulating and tumor-derived DNA and RNA and rapid reliable quantification of microRNA offers new opportunities to build extended prediction models across multiplatform data.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Győrffy, Balázs</author><author>Karn, Thomas</author><author>Sztupinszki, Zsófia</author><author>Weltz, Boglárka</author><author>Müller, Volkmar</author><author>Pusztai, Lajos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic classification using case-specific training cohorts outperforms static gene expression signatures in breast cancer.</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Cancer.

To overcome limitations of previous multigene prognostic classifiers, we propose a new dynamic predictor: instead of using a single universal training cohort and an identical list of informative genes to predict the prognosis of new cases, a case-specific predictor is developed for each test case. Gene expression data from 3,534 breast cancers with clinical annotation including relapse-free survival is analyzed. For each test case, we select a case-specific training subset including only molecularly similar cases and a case-specific predictor is generated. This method yields different training sets and different predictors for each new patient. The model performance was assessed in leave-one-out validation and also in 325 independent cases. Prognostic discrimination was high for all cases (n = 3,534, HR = 3.68, p = 1.67 E−56). The dynamic predictor showed higher overall accuracy (0.68) than genomic surrogates for Oncotype DX (0.64), Genomic Grade Index (0.61) or MammaPrint (0.47). The dynamic predictor was also effective in triple-negative cancers (n = 427, HR = 3.08, p = 0.0093) where the above classifiers all failed. Validation in independent patients yielded similar classification power (HR = 3.57). The dynamic classifier is available online at http://www.recurrenceonline.com/?q=Re_training. In summary, we developed a new method to make personalized prognostic prediction using case-specific training cohorts. The dynamic predictors outperform static models developed from single historical training cohorts and they also predict well in triple-negative cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Habel, Laurel A</author><author>Shak, Steven</author><author>Jacobs, Marlena K</author><author>Capra, Angela</author><author>Alexander, Claire</author><author>Pho, Mylan</author><author>Baker, Joffre</author><author>Walker, Michael</author><author>Watson, Drew</author><author>Hackett, James</author><author>Blick, Noelle T</author><author>Greenberg, Deborah</author><author>Fehrenbacher, Louis</author><author>Langholz, Bryan</author><author>Quesenberry, Charles P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A population-based study of tumor gene expression and risk of breast cancer death among lymph node-negative patients</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>R25</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2006</year></dates><isbn>1465-5411 1465-542X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/bcr1412</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr1412</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;em-death 10 years;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tos-case control;tos-validation</label><abstract>Introduction The Oncotype DX assay was recently reported to predict risk for distant recurrence among a clinical trial population of tamoxifen-treated patients with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. To confirm and extend these findings, we evaluated the performance of this 21-gene assay among node-negative patients from a community hospital setting. Methods A case-control study was conducted among 4,964 Kaiser Permanente patients diagnosed with node-negative invasive breast cancer from 1985 to 1994 and not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Cases (n = 220) were patients who died from breast cancer. Controls (n = 570) were breast cancer patients who were individually matched to cases with respect to age, race, adjuvant tamoxifen, medical facility and diagnosis year, and were alive at the date of death of their matched case. Using an RT-PCR assay, archived tumor tissues were analyzed for expression levels of 16 cancer-related and five reference genes, and a summary risk score (the Recurrence Score) was calculated for each patient. Conditional logistic regression methods were used to estimate the association between risk of breast cancer death and Recurrence Score. Results After adjusting for tumor size and grade, the Recurrence Score was associated with risk of breast cancer death in ER-positive, tamoxifen-treated and -untreated patients (P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively). At 10 years, the risks for breast cancer death in ER-positive, tamoxifen-treated patients were 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7–3.9%), 10.7% (95% CI 6.3–14.9%), and 15.5% (95% CI 7.6–22.8%) for those in the low, intermediate and high risk Recurrence Score groups, respectively. They were 6.2% (95% CI 4.5–7.9%), 17.8% (95% CI 11.8–23.3%), and 19.9% (95% CI 14.2–25.2%) for ER-positive patients not treated with tamoxifen. In both the tamoxifen-treated and -untreated groups, approximately 50% of patients had low risk Recurrence Score values. Conclusion In this large, population-based study of lymph node-negative patients not treated with chemotherapy, the Recurrence Score was strongly associated with risk of breast cancer death among ER-positive, tamoxifen-treated and -untreated patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Habermann, Jens K</author><author>Doering, Jana</author><author>Hautaniemi, Sampsa</author><author>Roblick, Uwe J</author><author>Bündgen, Nana K</author><author>Nicorici, Daniel</author><author>Kronenwett, Ulrike</author><author>Rathnagiriswaran, Shruti</author><author>Mettu, Rama K R</author><author>Ma, Yan</author><author>Krüger, Stefan</author><author>Bruch, Hans-Peter</author><author>Auer, Gert</author><author>Guo, Nancy L</author><author>Ried, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The gene expression signature of genomic instability in breast cancer is an independent predictor of clinical outcome</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1552-1564</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>0020-7136 1097-0215</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ijc.24017</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ijc.24017</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;tissue-present;tos-prospective</label><abstract>Recently, expression profiling of breast carcinomas has revealed gene signatures that predict clinical outcome, and discerned prognostically relevant breast cancer subtypes. Measurement of the degree of genomic instability provides a very similar stratification of prognostic groups. We therefore hypothesized that these features are linked. We used gene expression profiling of 48 breast cancer specimens that profoundly differed in their degree of genomic instability and identified a set of 12 genes that defines the two groups. The biological and prognostic significance of this gene set was established through survival prediction in published datasets from patients with breast cancer. Of note, the gene expression signatures that define specific prognostic subtypes in other breast cancer datasets, such as luminal A and B, basal, normal-like, and ERBB2+, and prognostic signatures including MammaPrint® and Oncotype DX, predicted genomic instability in our samples. This remarkable congruence suggests a biological interdependence of poor-prognosis gene signatures, breast cancer subtypes, genomic instability, and clinical outcome.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hannouf, Malek B</author><author>Xie, Bin</author><author>Brackstone, Muriel</author><author>Zaric, Gregory S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cost-effectiveness of a 21-gene recurrence score assay versus Canadian clinical practice in women with early-stage estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive, axillary lymph-node negative breast cancer.</title><secondary-title>BMC Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>447</pages><volume>12</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1471-2407</isbn><accession-num>23031196</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2407-12-447</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Hannouf et al. - 2012 - Cost-effectiveness of a 21-gene recurrence score assay versus Canadian clinical practice in women with early-sta.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3488327&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;NNT paper;Oncotype DX;fe-focus-economic;pmc99;pts-node-neg HR+;pts-simulated</label><abstract>Background: A 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay may inform adjuvant systematic treatment decisions in women with early stage breast cancer. We sought to investigate the cost effectiveness of using the RS-assay versus current clinical practice (CCP) in women with early-stage estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive, axilliary lymph-node negative breast cancer (ER+/ PR + LN- ESBC) from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system. Methods: We developed a Markov model to project the lifetime clinical and economic consequences of ESBC. We evaluated adjuvant therapy separately in post- and pre-menopausal women with ER+/ PR + LN- ESBC. We assumed that the RS-assay would reclassify pre- and post-menopausal women among risk levels (low, intermediate and high) and guide adjuvant systematic treatment decisions. The model was parameterized using 7 year follow up data from the Manitoba Cancer Registry, cost data from Manitoba administrative databases, and secondary sources. Costs are presented in 2010 CAD. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 5%. Results: The RS-assay compared to CCP generated cost-savings in pre-menopausal women and had an ICER of $60,000 per QALY gained in post-menopausal women. The cost effectiveness was most sensitive to the proportion of women classified as intermediate risk by the RS-assay who receive adjuvant chemotherapy and the risk of relapse in the RS-assay model. Conclusions: The RS-assay is likely to be cost effective in the Canadian healthcare system and should be considered for adoption in women with ER+/ PR + LN- ESBC. However, ongoing assessment and validation of the assay in real-world clinical practice is warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harbeck, Nadia</author><author>Sotlar, Karl</author><author>Wuerstlein, Rachel</author><author>Doisneau-Sixou, Sophie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular and protein markers for clinical decision making in breast cancer: today and tomorrow.</title><secondary-title>Cancer treatment reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer treatment reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>434-44</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biological: blood</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: blood</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: therapy</keyword><keyword>Combined Modality Therapy</keyword><keyword>Combined Modality Therapy: methods</keyword><keyword>Decision Making</keyword><keyword>Early Diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Tumor Markers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><accession-num>24138841</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ctrv.2013.09.014</electronic-resource-num><notes>review of many tests, and 6 CTs:

Thus, novel protein- and molecular markers have been put forward as decision aids. Since these potential prognosis and/or predictive tests differ substantially regarding their methodology, analytical and clinical validation, this review attempts to summarize the essential facts for clinicians. This review focuses on those markers which are the most advanced so far in their development towards routine clinical application, i.e. two protein markers (i.e. uPA/PAI-1 and IHC4) and six molecular multigene tests (i.e. Mammaprint®, Oncotype DX®, PAM50, Endopredict®, the 97-gene genomic grade, and 76 gene Rotterdam signatures). Next to methodological aspects, we summarized the clinical evidences, in particular the main prospective clinical trials which have already been fully recruited (i.e. MINDACT, TAILORx, WSG PLAN B) or are still ongoing (i.e. RxPONDER/SWOG S1007, WSG-ADAPT). Last but not least, this review points out the key elements for clinicians to select one test among the wide panel of proposed assays, for a specific population of patients in term of level of evidence, analytical and clinical validity as well as cost effectiveness.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hassett, Michael J</author><author>Silver, Samuel M</author><author>Hughes, Melissa E</author><author>Blayney, Douglas W</author><author>Edge, Stephen B</author><author>Herman, James G</author><author>Hudis, Clifford A</author><author>Marcom, P Kelly</author><author>Pettinga, Jane E</author><author>Share, David</author><author>Theriault, Richard</author><author>Wong, Y.-N.</author><author>Vandergrift, Jonathan L</author><author>Niland, Joyce C</author><author>Weeks, Jane C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adoption of Gene Expression Profile Testing and Association With Use of Chemotherapy Among Women With Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>2218-2226</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>0732-183X 1527-7755</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JCO.2011.38.5740</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JCO.2011.38.5740</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;fu-focus-usage;pmc99;pts-HR+;tos-prospective</label><abstract>Purpose: Gene expression profile (GEP) testing is a relatively new technology that offers the potential of personalized medicine to patients, yet little is known about its adoption into routine practice. One of the first commercially available GEP tests, a 21-gene profile, was developed to estimate the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for hormone receptor–positive breast cancer (HR-positive BC). Patients and Methods: By using a prospective registry data set outlining the routine care provided to women diagnosed from 2006 to 2008 with HR-positive BC at 17 comprehensive and community-based cancer centers, we assessed GEP test adoption and the association between testing and chemotherapy use. Results: Of 7,375 women, 20.4% had GEP testing and 50.2% received chemotherapy. Over time, testing increased (14.7% in 2006 to 27.5% in 2008; P &lt; .01) and use of chemotherapy decreased (53.9% in 2006 to 47.0% in 2008; P &lt; .01). Characteristics independently associated with lower odds of testing included African American versus white race (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.92) and high school or less versus more than high school education (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.76). Overall, testing was associated with lower odds of chemotherapy use (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.80). Stratified analyses demonstrated that for small, node-negative cancers, testing was associated with higher odds of chemotherapy use (OR, 11.13; 95% CI, 5.39 to 22.99), whereas for node-positive and large node-negative cancers, testing was associated with lower odds of chemotherapy use (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.17). Conclusion: There has been a progressive increase in use of this GEP test and an associated shift in the characteristics of and overall reduction in the proportion of women with HR-positive BC receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayes, Daniel F</author><author>Khoury, Muin J</author><author>Ransohoff, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Why Hasn’t Genomic Testing Changed the Landscape in Clinical Oncology?</title><secondary-title>American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book</full-title></periodical><pages>52-55</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>24451831</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.14694/EdBook_AM.2012.32.e52</electronic-resource-num><notes>&amp;quot;the difference between clinical/biologic validity and clinical utility&amp;quot;

Unfortunately, 10 years into the revolution, the promise of omics-based research has not yet been realized. The factors behind the slow progress in omics-based clinical care are many. First, over the last 15 years, there has been a gradual recognition of the importance of conducting tumor biomarker science with the kind of rigor that has traditionally been used for therapeutic research. However, this recognition has only recently been applied widely, and therefore most tumor biomarkers have insufficiently high levels of evidence to determine clinical utility. Second, omics-based research offers its own particular set of concerns, especially in regard to overfitting computational models and false discovery rates. Researchers and clinicians need to understand the importance of analytic validity, and the difference between clinical/biologic validity and clinical utility. The latter is required to introduce a tumor biomarker test of any kind (single analyte or omics-based), and are ideally generated by carefully planned and properly conducted &quot;prospective retrospective&quot; or truly prospective clinical trials. Only carefully planned studies, which take all three of these into account and in which the investigators are aware and recognize the enormous risk of unintended bias and overfitting inherent in omics-based test development, will ultimately result in translation of the exciting new technologies into better care for patients with cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Health Quality Ontario</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene Expression Profiling for Guiding Adjuvant Chemotherapy Decisions in Women with Early Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis</title><secondary-title>Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series</full-title></periodical><pages>1-57</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1915-7398</isbn><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23074401</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;em-distant recurrence 10 years;em-recurrence 10 years;interesting;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+PR+;tos-overview</label><abstract>: In February 2010, the Medical Advisory Secretariat (MAS) began work on evidence-based reviews of published literature surrounding three pharmacogenomic tests. This project came about when Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) asked MAS to provide evidence-based analyses on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three oncology pharmacogenomic tests currently in use in Ontario.Evidence-based analyses have been prepared for each of these technologies. These have been completed in conjunction with internal and external stakeholders, including a Provincial Expert Panel on Pharmacogenomics (PEPP). Within the PEPP, subgroup committees were developed for each disease area. For each technology, an economic analysis was also completed by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA) and is summarized within the reports.The following reports can be publicly accessed at the MAS website at: www.health.gov.on.ca/mas or at www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.htmlGene Expression Profiling for Guiding Adjuvant Chemotherapy Decisions in Women with Early Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Economic AnalysisEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation (EGFR) Testing for Prediction of Response to EGFR-Targeting Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Drugs in Patients with Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: An Evidence-Based and Ecopnomic AnalysisK-RAS testing in Treatment Decisions for Advanced Colorectal Cancer: an Evidence-Based and Economic Analysis Objective: To review and synthesize the available evidence regarding the laboratory performance, prognostic value, and predictive value of Oncotype-DX for the target population. Clinical Need: Condition and Target Population: The target population of this review is women with newly diagnosed early stage (stage I–IIIa) invasive breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone-receptor (PR) positive. Much of this review, however, is relevant for women with early stage (I and II) invasive breast cancer that is specifically ER positive, lymph node (LN) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) negative. This refined population represents an estimated incident population of 3,315 new breast cancers in Ontario (according to 2007 data). Currently it is estimated that only 15% of these women will develop a distant metastasis at 10 years; however, a far great proportion currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit. There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Technology of Concern: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR) expression. Research Questions: What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?*Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated with the risk of distant recurrence or death due to any cause in women with early breast cancer receiving tamoxifen?What is the predictive value of Oncotype-DX?*Does Oncoytpe-DX recurrence score predict significant benefit in terms of improvements in 10-year distant recurrence or death due to any cause for women receiving tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in comparison to women receiving tamoxifen alone?How does Oncotype-DX compare to other known predictors of risk such as Adjuvant! Online?How does Oncotype-DX impact patient quality of life and clinical/patient decision-making? Research Methods: Literature Search: Search Strategy: A literature search was performed on March 19th, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp; Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1st, 2006 to March 19th, 2010. A starting search date of January 1st, 2006 was because a comprehensive systematic review of Oncotype-DX was identified in preliminary literature searching. This systematic review, by Marchionni et al. (2008), included literature up to January 1st, 2007. All studies identified in the review by Marchionni et al. as well as those identified in updated literature searching were used to form the evidentiary base of this review. The quality of the overall body of evidence was identified as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. Inclusion Criteria: Any observational trial, controlled clinical trial, randomized controlled trial (RCT), meta-analysis or systematic review that reported on the laboratory performance, prognostic value and/or predictive value of Oncotype-DX testing, or other outcome relevant to the Key Questions, specific to the target population was included. Exclusion Criteria: Studies that did not report original data or original data analysis,Studies published in a language other than English,Studies reported only in abstract or as poster presentations (such publications were not sought nor included in this review since the MAS does not generally consider evidence that is not subject to peer review nor does the MAS consider evidence that lacks detailed description of methodology). Outcomes of Interest: Outcomes of interest varied depending on the Key Question. For the Key Questions of prognostic and predictive value (Key Questions #2 and #3), the prospectively defined primary outcome was risk of 10-year distant recurrence. The prospectively defined secondary outcome was 10-year death due to any cause (i.e., overall survival). All additional outcomes such as risk of locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival (DFS) were not prospectively determined for this review but were reported as presented in included trials; these outcomes are referenced as tertiary outcomes in this review. Outcomes for other Key Questions (i.e., Key Questions #1, #4 and #5) were not prospectively defined due to the variability in endpoints relevant for these questions. Summary of Findings: A total of 26 studies were included. Of these 26 studies, only five studies were relevant to the primary questions of this review (Key Questions #2 and #3). The following conclusions were drawn from the entire body of evidence:There is a lack of external validation to support the reliability of Oncotype-DX; however, the current available evidence derived from internal industry validation studies suggests that Oncotype-DX is reliable (i.e., Oncotype-DX is repeatable and reproducible).Current available evidence suggests a moderate failure rate of Oncotype-DX testing; however, the failure rate observed across clinical trials included in this review is likely inflated; the current Ontario experience suggests an acceptably lower rate of test failure.In women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer (stage I–II) that is estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node negative:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole (the latter for postmenopausal women only),There is very low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX can predict which women will benefit from adjuvant CMF/MF chemotherapy in women being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.In postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node positive:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole,There is very low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited predictive value for predicting which women will benefit from adjuvant CAF chemotherapy in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.There are methodological and statistical limitations that affect both the generalizability of the current available evidence, as well as the magnitude and statistical strength of the observed effect sizes; in particular:Of the major predictive trials, Oncotype-DX scores were only produced for a small subset of women (&lt;40% of the original randomized population) potentially disabling the effects of treatment randomization and opening the possibility of selection bias;Data is not specific to HER-2/neu-negative women;There were limitations with multivariate statistical analyses.Additional trials of observational design may provide further validation of the prognostic and predictive value of Oncotype-DX; however, it is unlikely that prospective or randomized data will become available in the near future due to ethical, time and resource considerations.There is currently insufficient evidence investigating how Oncoytpe-DX compares to other known prognostic estimators of risk, such as Adjuvant! Online, and there is insufficient evidence investigating how Oncotype-DX would impact clinician/patient decision-making in a setting generalizable to Ontario.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holt, S</author><author>Bertelli, G</author><author>Humphreys, I</author><author>Valentine, W</author><author>Durrani, S</author><author>Pudney, D</author><author>Rolles, M</author><author>Moe, M</author><author>Khawaja, S</author><author>Sharaiha, Y</author><author>Brinkworth, E</author><author>Whelan, S</author><author>Jones, S</author><author>Bennett, H</author><author>Phillips, C J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A decision impact, decision conflict and economic assessment of routine Oncotype DX testing of 146 women with node-negative or pNImi, ER-positive breast cancer in the UK</title><secondary-title>British Journal of Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British Journal of Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>2250-2258</pages><volume>108</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0007-0920 1532-1827</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/bjc.2013.207</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/bjc.2013.207</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;doctor focus;economic focus;fe-focus-economic;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;patient confidence;pmc99</label><abstract>Background:: Tumour gene expression analysis is useful in predicting adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in early breast cancer patients. This study aims to examine the implications of routine Oncotype DX testing in the UK. Methods:: Women with oestrogen receptor positive (ER+), pNO or pN1mi breast cancer were assessed for adjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently offered Oncotype DX testing, with changes in chemotherapy decisions recorded. A subset of patients completed questionnaires about their uncertainties regarding chemotherapy decisions pre- and post-testing. All patients were asked to complete a diary of medical interactions over the next 6 months, from which economic data were extracted to model the cost-effectiveness of testing. Results:: Oncotype DX testing resulted in changes in chemotherapy decisions in 38 of 142 (26.8%) women, with 26 of 57 (45.6%) spared chemotherapy and 12 of 85 (14.1%) requiring chemotherapy when not initially recommended (9.9% reduction overall). Decision conflict analysis showed that Oncotype DX testing increased patients' confidence in treatment decision making. Economic analysis showed that routine Oncotype DX testing costs £6232 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Conclusion:: Oncotype DX decreased chemotherapy use and increased confidence in treatment decision making in patients with ER+ early-stage breast cancer. Based on these findings, Oncotype DX is cost-effective in the UK setting.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hornberger, John</author><author>Chien, Rebecca</author><author>Krebs, Katie</author><author>Hochheiser, Louis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>US Insurance Program's Experience With a Multigene Assay for Early-Stage Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>e38s-e45s</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>3S</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1554-7477 1935-469X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JOP.2011.000303</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jop.ascopubs.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JOP.2011.000303</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fe-focus-economic;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>This study presents Humana's experience with a multigene breast cancer assay and provides an analysis of the clinical utility and economics of this technology.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Jiaqi</author><author>Morehouse, Chris</author><author>Streicher, Katie</author><author>Higgs, Brandon W</author><author>Gao, Jin</author><author>Czapiga, Meggan</author><author>Boutrin, Anmarie</author><author>Zhu, Wei</author><author>Brohawn, Philip</author><author>Chang, Yong</author><author>Viner, Jaye</author><author>LaVallee, Theresa</author><author>Richman, Laura</author><author>Jallal, Bahija</author><author>Yao, Yihong</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Batra, S.

In the present study, we (a) developed quantitative TaqMan real time-PCR-based assays (qRT-PCR) to measure human insulin receptor isoforms with high specificity, (b) evaluated isoform expression levels in molecularly-defined breast cancer subtypes, and (c) identified the IR-A:IR-B mRNA ratio as a potential biomarker guiding patient stratification for anti-IGF therapies. Experimental Design: mRNA expression levels of IR-A and IR-B were measured in 42 primary breast cancers and 19 matched adjacent normal tissues with TaqMan qRT-PCR assays. The results were further confirmed in 165 breast cancers. The tumor samples were profiled using whole genome microarrays and subsequently subtyped using the PAM50 breast cancer gene signature. The relationship between the IR-A:IR-B ratio and cancer subtype, as well as markers of proliferation were characterized. Results: The mRNA expression levels of IR-A in the breast tumors were similar to those observed in the adjacent normal tissues, while the mRNA levels of IR-B were significantly decreased in tumors. The IR-A:IR-B ratio was significantly higher in luminal B breast cancer than in luminal A. Strong concordance between the IR-A:IR-B ratio and the composite Oncotype DX proliferation score was observed for stratifying the latter two breast cancer subtypes.

The goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new 21-gene assay (ODX) when used in conjunction with the Adjuvant! Online (AO) decision aid to support personalized decisions about use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer patients in Austria. We applied a validated discrete-event-simulation model to a hypothetical cohort of 50 years old women over a lifetime horizon. The test-treatment strategies of interest were defined using three-letter acronyms. The first (second, third) letter indicates whether patients with a low (intermediate, high) risk according to AO were tested using ODX (Y yes, N no). The main outcomes were life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and cost effectiveness. Robustness of the results was tested in sensitivity analyses. Results were compared to a Canadian analysis conducted by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA). Five of eight strategies were dominated (i.e., more costly and less effective: NNY, NYN, YNN, YNY, YYN). The base-case analysis shows that YYY (ODX provided to all patients) is the most effective strategy and is cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 15,700 EUR per QALY gained. These results are sensitive to changes in the probabilities of distant recurrence, age and costs of chemotherapy. The results of the base-case analysis were comparable to the THETA results. Based on our analyses, using ODX in addition to AO is effective and cost effective in all women in Austria. The development of future genetic tests may require alternative or additional test-treatment strategies to be evaluated.Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40064-015-1440-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Janes, Holly</author><author>Pepe, Margaret S</author><author>Bossuyt, Patrick M</author><author>Barlow, William E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring the Performance of Markers for Guiding Treatment Decisions</title><secondary-title>Annals of Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>253</pages><volume>154</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological Markers</keyword><keyword>Clinical Protocols</keyword><keyword>Clinical Protocols: standards</keyword><keyword>Decision Making</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic: methods</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic: standards</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>0110215000006</isbn><accession-num>21320940</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7326/0003-4819-154-4-201102150-00006</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3085402&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url><url>http://annals.org/article.aspx?doi=10.7326/0003-4819-154-4-201102150-00006</url></web-urls></urls><label>JULIA;NNT paper;Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;done;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;overview;tos-overview</label><abstract>Treatment selection markers, sometimes called predictive markers, are factors that help clinicians select therapies that maximize good outcomes and minimize adverse outcomes for patients. Existing statistical methods for evaluating a treatment selection marker include assessing its prognostic value, evaluating treatment effects in patients with a restricted range of marker values, and testing for a statistical interaction between marker value and treatment. These methods are inadequate, because they give misleading measures of performance that do not answer key clinical questions about how the marker might help patients choose treatment, how treatment decisions should be made on the basis of a continuous marker measurement, what effect using the marker to select treatment would have on the population, or what proportion of patients would have treatment changes on the basis of marker measurement. Marker-by-treatment predictiveness curves are proposed as a more useful aid to answering these clinically relevant questions, because they illustrate treatment effects as a function of marker value, outcomes when using or not using the marker to select treatment, and the proportion of patients for whom treatment recommendations change after marker measurement. Randomized therapeutic clinical trials, in which entry criteria and treatment regimens are not restricted by the marker, are also proposed as the basis for constructing the curves and evaluating and comparing markers.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jegadeesh, Naresh K</author><author>Kim, Sunjin</author><author>Prabhu, Roshan S</author><author>Oprea, Gabriela M</author><author>Yu, David S</author><author>Godette, Karen G</author><author>Zelnak, Amelia B</author><author>Mister, Donna</author><author>Switchenko, Jeffrey M</author><author>Torres, Mylin A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 21-Gene Recurrence Score and Locoregional Recurrence in Breast Cancer Patients</title><secondary-title>Annals of Surgical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Surgical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>1088-1094</pages><volume>22</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1068-9265 1534-4681</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1245/s10434-014-4252-y</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1245/s10434-014-4252-y</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;pts-ER+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Purpose: Although the 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay has been validated to assess the risk of distant recurrence in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients, the relationship between RS and the risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) remains unclear.

Prognostic and predictive gene signatures for node-negative breast cancer have a high number of genes related to proliferation. The prognostic value of gene sets from commercial gene-expression assays were compared with proliferation markers. Methods: Illumina WG6 mRNA microarray analysis was used to examine 94 fresh-frozen tumour samples from node-negative breast cancer patients. The patients were divided into low- and high-risk groups for distant metastasis based on the MammaPrint-related genes, and into low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups based on the recurrence score algorithm with genes included in Oncotype DX. These data were then compared to proliferation status, as measured by the mitotic activity index, the expressions of phosphohistone H3 (PPH3), and Ki67. Results: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for distant-metastasis-free survival revealed that patients with weak and strong PPH3 expressions had 14-year survival rates of 87% (n = 45), and 65% (n = 49, p = 0.014), respectively.

This study investigated whether breast cancer molecular subtyping according to its global intrinsic biology could be used for treatment customization. Methods: Gene expression profiling was conducted on fresh frozen breast cancer tissue collected from 327 patients in conjunction with thoroughly documented clinical data. A method of molecular subtyping based on 783 probe-sets was established and validated. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate molecular subtypes with survival outcome and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Heterogeneity of molecular subtypes within groups sharing the same distant recurrence risk predicted by genes of the Oncotype and MammaPrint predictors was studied. Results: We identified six molecular subtypes of breast cancer demonstrating distinctive molecular and clinical characteristics. These six subtypes showed similarities and significant differences from the Perou-Sørlie intrinsic types. Subtype I breast cancer was in concordance with chemosensitive basal-like intrinsic type. Adjuvant chemotherapy of lower intensity with CMF yielded survival outcome similar to those of CAF in this subtype. Subtype IV breast cancer was positive for ER with a full-range expression of HER2, responding poorly to CMF; however, this subtype showed excellent survival when treated with CAF. Reduced expression of a gene associated with methotrexate sensitivity in subtype IV was the likely reason for poor response to methotrexate. All subtype V breast cancer was positive for ER and had excellent long-term survival with hormonal therapy alone following surgery and/or radiation therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide any survival benefit in early stages of subtype V patients. Subtype V was consistent with a unique subset of luminal A intrinsic type. When molecular subtypes were correlated with recurrence risk predicted by genes of Oncotype and MammaPrint predictors, a significant degree of heterogeneity within the same risk group was noted. This heterogeneity was distributed over several subtypes, suggesting that patients in the same risk groups require different treatment approaches. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the molecular subtypes established in this study can be utilized for customization of breast cancer treatment.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Katz, Gregory</author><author>Romano, Olivier</author><author>Foa, Cyril</author><author>Vataire, Anne-Lise</author><author>Chantelard, Jean-Victor</author><author>Hervé, Robert</author><author>Barletta, Hugues</author><author>Durieux, Axel</author><author>Martin, Jean-Pierre</author><author>Salmon, Rémy</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Lo, Anthony W.I.</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Economic Impact of Gene Expression Profiling in Patients with Early-Stage Breast Cancer in France</title><secondary-title>PLOS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLOS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e0128880</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0128880</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128880</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fe-focus-economic;pmc99;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Background and Aims: The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer can make decisions on adjuvant chemotherapy following surgical resection challenging. Oncotype DX is a validated gene expression profiling test that predicts the likelihood of adjuvant chemotherapy benefit in early-stage breast cancer. The aim of this study is to determine the costs of chemotherapy in private hospitals in France, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Oncotype DX from national insurance and societal perspectives. Methods: A multicenter study was conducted in seven French private hospitals, capturing retrospective data from 106 patient files. Cost estimates were used in conjunction with a published Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of using Oncotype DX to inform chemotherapy decision making versus standard care. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: The cost of adjuvant chemotherapy in private hospitals was estimated at EUR 8,218 per patient from a national insurance perspective and EUR 10,305 from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that introducing Oncotype DX improved life expectancy (+0.18 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (+0.17 QALYs) versus standard care. Oncotype DX was found cost-effective from a national insurance perspective (EUR 2,134 per QALY gained) and cost saving from a societal perspective versus standard care. Inclusion of lost productivity costs in the modeling analysis meant that costs for eligible patients undergoing Oncotype DX testing were on average EUR 602 lower than costs for those receiving standard care. Conclusions: As Oncotype DX was found both cost and life-saving from a societal perspective, the test was considered to be dominant to standard care. However, the delay in coverage has the potential to erode the quality of the French healthcare system, thus depriving patients of technologies that could improve clinical outcomes and allow healthcare professionals to better allocate hospital resources to improve the standard of care for all patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelly, Catherine M</author><author>Bernard, Philip S</author><author>Krishnamurthy, Savitri</author><author>Wang, Bailiang</author><author>Ebbert, Mark T W</author><author>Bastien, Roy R L</author><author>Boucher, Kenneth M</author><author>Young, Elliana</author><author>Iwamoto, Takayuki</author><author>Pusztai, Lajos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Agreement in Risk Prediction Between the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay (Oncotype DX(R)) and the PAM50 Breast Cancer Intrinsic Classifier in Early-Stage Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>The Oncologist</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Oncologist</full-title></periodical><pages>492-498</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1083-7159 1549-490X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/doi/10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0007</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;compare-PAM50;fl-focus-laboratory;pmc99;pts-HR+</label><abstract>Risk assignment in breast cancer patients using the PAM50 Breast Cancer Intrinsic Classifier™ and the Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score in the same population was compared.

Clinically, these signatures are usually used in early-stage cancers to evaluate whether they require adjuvant therapy following surgical resection. A molecular signature that is prognostic across more clinical contexts would be a useful addition to current signatures. Methods: We defined a signature for the ubiquitous tissue factor, E2F4, based on its shared target genes in multiple tissues. These target genes were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments using a probabilistic method. We then computationally calculated the regulatory activity score (RAS) of E2F4 in cancer tissues, and examined how E2F4 RAS correlates with patient survival. Results: Genes in our E2F4 signature were 21-fold more likely to be correlated with breast cancer patient survival time compared to randomly selected genes. Using eight independent breast cancer datasets containing over 1,900 unique samples, we stratified patients into low and high E2F4 RAS groups. E2F4 activity stratification was highly predictive of patient outcome, and our results remained robust even when controlling for many factors including patient age, tumor size, grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, lymph node (LN) status, whether the patient received adjuvant therapy, and the patient’s other prognostic indices such as Adjuvant! and the Nottingham Prognostic Index scores. Furthermore, the fractions of samples with positive E2F4 RAS vary in different intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, consistent with the different survival profiles of these subtypes. Conclusions: We defined a prognostic signature, the E2F4 regulatory activity score, and showed it to be significantly predictive of patient outcome in breast cancer regardless of treatment status and the states of many other clinicopathological variables. It can be used in conjunction with other breast cancer classification methods such as Oncotype DX to improve clinical outcome prediction.

Cognitive dysfunction is utilized as a representative breast cancer survivor symptom to elucidate the conceptualization of and justification for our cellular, disease-based approach to address symptom variability in cancer survivors. Initial candidate gene identification was based on genes evaluated as part of multigene expression profiles for breast cancer, which are commonly used in the clinical setting to characterize the biology of cancer cells for the purpose of describing overall tumor aggressiveness, prognostication, and individualization of therapy. A list of genes evaluated within five multigene expression profiles for breast cancer was compiled. In order to prioritize candidate genes for investigation, genes used in each profile were compared for duplication. Twenty-one genes (BAG1, BCL2, BIRC5, CCNB1, CENPA, CMC2, DIAPH3, ERBB2, ESR1, GRB7, MELK, MKI67, MMP11, MYBL2, NDC80, ORC6, PGR, RACGAP1, RFC4, RRM2, and SCUBE2) are utilized in two or more profiles, including five genes (CCNB1, CENPA, MELK, MYBL2, and ORC6) used in three profiles. To ensure that the parsimonious 21 gene set is representative of the more global biological hallmarks of cancer, an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was conducted. Evaluation of genes known to impact pathways involved with cancer development and progression provide a means to evaluate the overlap between the biological underpinnings of cancer and symptom development within the context of cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Moo Hyun</author><author>Han, Wonshik</author><author>Lee, Jeong Eon</author><author>Kim, Ku Sang</author><author>Park, Heeseung</author><author>Kim, Jongjin</author><author>Bae, Soo Youn</author><author>Shin, Hyun Joo</author><author>Lee, Jong Won</author><author>Lee, Eun Sook</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Clinical Impact of 21-Gene Recurrence Score on Treatment Decisions for Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive Early Breast Cancer in Korea</title><secondary-title>Cancer Research and Treatment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer Research and Treatment</full-title></periodical><pages>208-214</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1598-2998 2005-9256</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4143/crt.2013.223</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://e-crt.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4143/crt.2013.223</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pmc99;pts-ER+;pts-HR+;tissue-present;tos-prospective</label><abstract>Purpose: The 21-gene (Oncotype DX) recurrence score (RS) assay is useful in predicting the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer patients and is widely used in Western countries. However, to date, it has not gained much popularity in East Asia. We analyzed the results from five institutions’ experience from using the 21-gene assay and examined the impact of assay results on decision making of chemotherapy in Korean breast cancer patients and the associations between RS and clinicopathologic characteristics. Materials and Methods: The 21-gene assay was performed on 212 patients with estrogen receptor-positive early breast cancer in five institutions. Each center made systemic treatment decisions both before and after the knowledge of assay results. Results: Among the 212 patients, 132 (62.3%) had a low RS of &lt; 18, 60 (28.3%) had an intermediate RS of 18-30, and 20 (9.4%) had a high RS of ≥ 31. Histologic grade, presence of micrometastases, Ki-67, and presence of lymphatic invasion were statistically associated with the RS results. Treatment decisions were changed in 115 of 212 patients (54.2%) in 109 of 212 (51.4%) from chemotherapy plus hormone therapy to hormone therapy, and in six of 212 (2.8%) from hormone therapy to chemotherapy plus hormone therapy.

Because this classification still includes a heterogeneous collection of tumors, new tools to classify TNBCs are urgently required in order to improve our prognostic capability for high risk patients and predict response to therapy. We previously defined a gene expression signature, RKIP Pathway Metastasis Signature (RPMS), based upon a metastasis-suppressive signaling pathway initiated by Raf Kinase Inhibitory Protein (RKIP). We have now generated a new BACH1 Pathway Metastasis gene signature (BPMS) that utilizes targets of the metastasis regulator BACH1. Specifically, we substituted experimentally validated target genes to generate a new BACH1 metagene, developed an approach to optimize patient tumor stratification, and reduced the number of signature genes to 30. The BPMS significantly and selectively stratified metastasis-free survival in basal-like and, in particular, TNBC patients. In addition, the BPMS further stratified patients identified as having a good or poor prognosis by other signatures including the Mammaprint® and Oncotype® clinical tests. The BPMS is thus complementary to existing signatures and is a prognostic tool for high risk</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liedtke, Cornelia</author><author>Bernemann, Christof</author><author>Kiesel, Ludwig</author><author>Rody, Achim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic Profiling in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Breast Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Care</full-title></periodical><pages>414-422</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1661-3791 1661-3805</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1159/000357535</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.karger.com?doi=10.1159/000357535</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;notrelevant;pmc99;pts-HR+</label><abstract>The developments in gene expression analysis have made it possible to sub-classify hormone receptor-positive (luminal) breast cancer in different prognostic subgroups.

Since the advent of the initial cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) regimens, which reduced risk for recurrence and death, anthracyclines and subsequently taxanes were added to the cytotoxic armamentarium for use sequentially or in combination in the adjuvant setting. The efficacy and toxicity of each chemotherapy regimen must be viewed within the context of host co-morbidities and the specific biologic phenotype of the tumor. In the era of mammographic screening, small, node-negative breast cancer is the most frequent presentation of the disease. Patient selection for adjuvant chemotherapy has become a key issue. Traditional prognostic factors continue to be of value in determining the risk for relapse, but new and sophisticated genomic tools (such as Oncotype Dx® and Mammaprint®) are now available and may improve our ability to select patients. For those patients who do require adjuvant chemotherapy, the 'one size fits all' paradigm should never again feature in the treatment of early breast cancer, following the important insights yielded by biomarker research to identify those who will benefit the most from a particular drug. In this review we focus on some of the current controversies and potential future steps in adjuvant chemotherapy for treatment of early breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lyman, Gary H</author><author>Cosler, Leon E</author><author>Kuderer, Nicole M</author><author>Hornberger, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of a 21-gene RT-PCR assay on treatment decisions in early-stage breast cancer: an economic analysis based on prognostic and predictive validation studies.</title><secondary-title>Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1011-8</pages><volume>109</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adjuvant</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Agents</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>Cost-Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Disease-Free Survival</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression</keyword><keyword>Hormonal</keyword><keyword>Hormonal: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Local</keyword><keyword>Local: diagnosis</keyword><keyword>Local: pathology</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes: pathology</keyword><keyword>Messenger</keyword><keyword>Messenger: analysis</keyword><keyword>Monte Carlo Method</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>RNA</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction: e</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction: m</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen: therapeutic use</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><accession-num>17311307</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/cncr.22506</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17311307</url></web-urls></urls><label>OncotypeDX_EM;done;economic focus;em-distant recurrence 10 years;fe-focus-economic;pts-node-neg ER+;tos-retrospective;tos-validation</label><abstract>The prognostic accuracy for distant recurrence-free survival using a 21-gene reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay underwent validation in 668 lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive women with early-stage breast cancer receiving tamoxifen on National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Program (NSABP) B-14.

The novel methodological contribution is in the use of a multi-field-of-view (multi-FOV) framework for integrating image-based information from differently stained histopathology slides. The multi-FOV approach involves a fixed image resolution while simultaneously integrating image descriptors from many FOVs corresponding to different sizes. For each study, the corresponding risk score (high scores reflecting aggressive disease and vice versa), predicted by a molecular assay (Oncotype DX), is available and serves as the surrogate ground truth for long-term patient outcome. Using the risk scores, a trained classifier is used to identify disease aggressiveness for each FOV size. The predictions for each FOV are then combined to yield the final prediction of disease aggressiveness (good, intermediate, or poor outcome). Independent multi-FOV classifiers are constructed for (1) 50 image features describing the spatial arrangement of cancer nuclei (via Voronoi diagram, Delaunay triangulation, and minimum spanning tree graphs) in H and E stained histopathology and (2) one image feature describing the vascular density in CD34 IHC stained histopathology. In a cohort of 29 patients, the multi-FOV classifiers obtained by combining information from the H and E and CD34 IHC stained channels were able to distinguish low- and high-risk patients with an accuracy of 0.91 ± 0.02 and a positive predictive value of 0.94 ± 0.10, suggesting that a purely image-based assay could potentially replace more expensive molecular assays for making disease prognostic predictions.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Madden, Stephen F</author><author>Clarke, Colin</author><author>Gaule, Patricia</author><author>Aherne, Sinead T</author><author>O'Donovan, Norma</author><author>Clynes, Martin</author><author>Crown, John</author><author>Gallagher, William M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BreastMark: An Integrated Approach to Mining Publicly Available Transcriptomic Datasets Relating to Breast Cancer Outcome.</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research : BCR</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research : BCR</full-title></periodical><pages>R52</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>BioMed Central Ltd</publisher><isbn>1465-5411 1465-542X</isbn><accession-num>23820017</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/bcr3444</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://bcr3444.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3978487&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;notrelevant;pmc99l</label><abstract>Introduction: Breast cancer is a complex heterogeneous disease for which a substantial resource of transcriptomic data is available. Gene expression data have facilitated the division of breast cancer into, at least, five molecular subtypes, namely luminal A, luminal B, HER2, normal-like and basal. Once identified, breast cancer subtypes can inform clinical decisions surrounding patient treatment and prognosis. Indeed, it is important to identify patients at risk of developing aggressive disease so as to tailor the level of clinical intervention. Methods: We have developed a user-friendly, web-based system to allow the evaluation of genes/microRNAs (miRNAs) that are significantly associated with survival in breast cancer and its molecular subtypes. The algorithm combines gene expression data from multiple microarray experiments which frequently also contain miRNA expression information, and detailed clinical data to correlate outcome with gene/miRNA expression levels. This algorithm integrates gene expression and survival data from 26 datasets on 12 different microarray platforms corresponding to approximately 17,000 genes in up to 4,738 samples. In addition, the prognostic potential of 341 miRNAs can be analysed. Results: We demonstrated the robustness of our approach in comparison to two commercially available prognostic tests, oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Our algorithm complements these prognostic tests and is consistent with their findings. In addition, BreastMark can act as a powerful reductionist approach to these more complex gene signatures, eliminating superfluous genes, potentially reducing the cost and complexity of these multi-index assays. Known miRNA prognostic markers, mir-205 and mir-93, were used to confirm the prognostic value of this tool in a miRNA setting. We also applied the algorithm to examine expression of 58 receptor tyrosine kinases in the basal-like subtype, identifying six receptor tyrosine kinases associated with poor disease-free survival and/or overall survival (EPHA5, FGFR1, FGFR3, VEGFR1, PDGFRβ, and TIE1). A web application for using this algorithm is currently available. Conclusions: BreastMark is a powerful tool for examining putative gene/miRNA prognostic markers in breast cancer. The value of this tool will be in the preliminary assessment of putative biomarkers in breast cancer. It will be of particular use to research groups with limited bioinformatics facilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mamounas, Eleftherios P</author><author>Tang, Gong</author><author>Fisher, Bernard</author><author>Paik, Soonmyung</author><author>Shak, Steven</author><author>Costantino, Joseph P</author><author>Watson, Drew</author><author>Geyer, Charles E</author><author>Wickerham, D Lawrence</author><author>Wolmark, Norman</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association Between the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay and Risk of Locoregional Recurrence in Node-Negative, Estrogen Receptor–Positive Breast Cancer: Results From NSABP B-14 and NSABP B-20.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>1677-1683</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Clinical Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Estrogen</keyword><keyword>Estrogen: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Hormone-Dependent</keyword><keyword>Hormone-Dependent: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Hormone-Dependent: genetics</keyword><keyword>Hormone-Dependent: pathology</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Local</keyword><keyword>Local: genetics</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Metastasis: genetics</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen: therapeutic use</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>0732-183X 1527-7755</isbn><accession-num>20065188</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JCO.2009.23.7610</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Mamounas et al. - 2010 - Association between the 21-gene recurrence score assay and risk of locoregional recurrence in node-negative,(4).pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2849763&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;NNT paper;OncoType DX;Oncotype DX;em-locoregional recurrence 10 year;fpb-focus-patient benefit from chemo;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;interesting;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective;tos-validation</label><abstract>Purpose The 21-gene OncotypeDX recurrence score (RS) assay quantifies the risk of distant recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer. We investigated the association between RS and risk for locoregional recurrence (LRR) in patients with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer from two National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials (NSABP B-14 and B-20). Patients and Methods RS was available for 895 tamoxifen-treated patients (from both trials), 355 placebo-treated patients (from B-14), and 424 chemotherapy plus tamoxifen-treated patients (from B-20). The primary end point was time to first LRR. Distant metastases, second primary cancers, and deaths before LRR were censored. Results In tamoxifen-treated patients, LRR was significantly associated with RS risk groups (P &lt; .001). The 10-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of LRR was 4.% (95% CI, 2.3% to 6.3%) for patients with a low RS (&lt; 18), 7.2% (95% CI, 3.4% to 11.0%) for those with intermediate RS (18-30), and 15.8% (95% CI, 10.4% to 21.2%) for those with a high RS (&gt; 30). There were also significant associations between RS and LRR in placebo-treated patients from B-14 (P = .022) and in chemotherapy plus tamoxifen–treated patients from B-20 (P = .028). In multivariate analysis, RS was an independent significant predictor of LRR along with age and type of initial treatment. Conclusion Similar to the association between RS and risk for distant recurrence, a significant association exists between RS and risk for LRR. This information has biologic consequences and potential clinical implications relative to locoregional therapy decisions for patients with node-negative and ER-positive breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manjili, Masoud H</author><author>Najarian, Kayvan</author><author>Wang, Xiang-Yang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Signatures of tumor–immune interactions as biomarkers for breast cancer prognosis</title><secondary-title>Future Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>703-711</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>1479-6694 1744-8301</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2217/fon.12.57</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.futuremedicine.com/doi/abs/10.2217/fon.12.57</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;notrelevant;pmc99;tos-overview</label><abstract>Breast cancer mortality is usually due to distant recurrence of cancer at an advanced stage of the disease rather than from primary cancer. Therefore, prediction of breast cancer recurrence at the time of diagnosis could lead to advances in personalized treatment of cancer patients in order to prevent risk of recurrence. Two prognostic biomarkers that are currently being used in clinical practice are a 70-gene MammaPrint® signature and a 21-gene Oncotype DX® panel. These assays generate relative risks of recurrence, but they do not provide a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer about recurrence in a given patient. These tests include genes that are involved in the cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis related to breast cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that a signature of genes involved in tumor-immune interactions may provide a more accurate prognostic tool. This paper reviews recent advances in the discovery of prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mannelqvist, Monica</author><author>Wik, Elisabeth</author><author>Stefansson, Ingunn M</author><author>Akslen, Lars A</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Rameshwar, Pranela</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>An 18-Gene Signature for Vascular Invasion Is Associated with Aggressive Features and Reduced Survival in Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e98787</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0098787</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098787</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;compare-novel;em-hazard ratio;em-recurrence free survival;pmc99;pts-GSE-not-specified</label><abstract>Aims: Vascular invasion by tumor cells is known to be important for cancer progression. By microarray and qPCR analyses, we earlier identified an 18-gene signature associated with vascular involvement in endometrial cancer. Here, we explored the significance of this vascular invasion signature in multiple series of breast cancer patients. Methods and Results: The study includes 11 open access gene expression data sets which collectively provide information on 2423 breast cancer patients. The 18-gene signature showed consistent associations with aggressive features of breast cancer, like high tumor grade, hormone receptor negativity, HER2 positivity, a basal-like phenotype, reduced patient survival, and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Also, the vascular invasion signature was associated with several other gene expression profiles related to vascular biology and tumor progression, including the Oncotype DX breast cancer recurrence signature. Conclusions: The 18-gene vascular invasion signature showed strong and consistent associations with aggressive features of breast cancer and reduced survival.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marchionni, Luigi</author><author>Wilson, Renee F</author><author>Marinopoulos, Spyridon S</author><author>Wolff, Antonio C</author><author>Parmigiani, Giovanni</author><author>Bass, Eric B</author><author>Goodman, Steven N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of gene expression profiling tests on breast cancer outcomes.</title><secondary-title>Evidence report/technology assessment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Evidence report/technology assessment</full-title></periodical><pages>1-105</pages><issue>160</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: therapy</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Microarray Analysis</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Treatment Outcome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><publisher>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US)</publisher><accession-num>18457476</accession-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/PMH0007356/</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fe-focus-economic;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;interesting;pmc99;tos-RCT;tos-retrospective;tos-validation</label><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To assess the evidence that three marketed gene expression-based assays improve prognostic accuracy, treatment choice, and health outcomes in women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. REVIEW METHODS: We evaluated the evidence for three gene expression assays on the market; Oncotype DX, MammaPrint and the Breast Cancer Profiling (BCP or H/I ratio) test, and for gene expression signatures underlying the assays. We sought evidence on: analytic performance of tests, clinical validity (i.e., prognostic accuracy and discrimination), clinical utility (i.e., prediction of treatment benefit), harms, impact on clinical decision making and health care costs. RESULTS: Few papers were found on the analytic validity of the Oncotype DX and MammaPrint tests, but these showed reasonable within-laboratory replicability. Pre-analytic issues related to sample storage and preparation may play a larger role than within-laboratory variation. For clinical validity, studies differed according to whether they examined the actual test that is currently being offered to patients or the underlying gene signature. Almost all of the Oncotype DX evidence was for the marketed test, the strongest validation study being from one arm of a randomized controlled trial (NSABP-14) with a clinically homogeneous population. This study showed that the test, added in a clinically meaningful manner to standard prognostic indices. The MammaPrint signature and test itself was examined in studies with clinically heterogeneous populations (e.g., mix of ER positivity and tamoxifen treatment) and showed a clinically relevant separation of patients into risk categories, but it was not clear exactly how many predictions would be shifted across decision thresholds if this were used in combination with traditional indices. The BCP test itself was examined in one study, and the signature was tested in a variety of formulations in several studies. One randomized controlled trial provided high quality retrospective evidence of the clinical utility of Oncotype DX to predict chemotherapy treatment benefit, but evidence for clinical utility was not found for MammaPrint or the H/I ratio. Three decision analyses examined the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer gene expression assays, and overall were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Oncotype DX is furthest along the validation pathway, with strong retrospective evidence that it predicts distant spread and chemotherapy benefit to a clinically relevant extent over standard predictors, in a well-defined clinical subgroup with clear treatment implications. The evidence for clinical implications of using MammaPrint was not as clear as with Oncotype DX, and the ability to predict chemotherapy benefit does not yet exist. The H/I ratio test requires further validation. For all tests, the relationship of predicted to observed risk in different populations still needs further study, as does their incremental contribution, optimal implementation, and relevance to patients on current therapies.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marrone, Michael</author><author>Stewart, Alison</author><author>Dotson, W David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical utility of gene-expression profiling in women with early breast cancer: an overview of systematic reviews</title><secondary-title>Genetics in Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetics in Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>519-532</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1098-3600 1530-0366</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/gim.2014.140</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/gim.2014.140</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fe-focus-economic;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pmc99;tos-overview</label><abstract>Purpose: This overview systematically evaluates the clinical utility of using Oncotype DX and MammaPrint gene-expression profiling tests to direct treatment decisions in women with breast cancer. The findings are intended to inform an updated recommendation from the Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention Working Group. Methods: Evidence reported in systematic reviews evaluating the clinical utility of Oncotype DX and MammaPrint, as well as the ability to predict treatment outcomes, change in treatment decisions, and cost-effectiveness, was qualitatively synthesized. Results: Five systematic reviews found no direct evidence of clinical utility for either test. Indirect evidence showed Oncotype DX was able to predict treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas no evidence of predictive value was found for MammaPrint. Both tests influenced a change in treatment recommendations in 21 to 74% of participants. The cost-effectiveness of Oncotype DX varied with the alternative compared. For MammaPrint, lack of evidence of the predictive value led to uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: No studies were identified that provided direct evidence that using gene-expression profiling tests to direct treatment decisions improved outcomes in women with breast cancer. Three ongoing studies may provide direct evidence for determining the clinical utility of gene-expression profiling testing.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McShane, Lisa M</author><author>Hayes, Daniel F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Publication of tumor marker research results: the necessity for complete and transparent reporting.</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>4223-32</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>34</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>23071235</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JCO.2012.42.6858</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23071235</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;OncotypeDX_EM;notrelevant;tos-discussion</label><abstract>Clinical management decisions for patients with cancer are increasingly being guided by prognostic and predictive markers. Use of these markers should be based on a sufficiently comprehensive body of unbiased evidence to establish that benefits to patients outweigh harms and to justify expenditure of health care dollars. Careful assessments of the clinical utility of markers by using comparative effectiveness research methods are urgently needed to more rigorously summarize and evaluate the evidence, but multiple factors have made such assessments difficult. The literature on tumor markers is plagued by nonpublication bias, selective reporting, and incomplete reporting. Several measures to address these problems are discussed, including development of a tumor marker study registry, greater attention to assay analytic performance and specimen quality, use of more rigorous study designs and analysis plans to establish clinical utility, and adherence to higher standards for reporting tumor marker studies. More complete and transparent reporting by adhering to criteria such as BRISQ [Biospecimen Reporting for Improved Study Quality] criteria for reporting details about specimens and REMARK [Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies] criteria for reporting a multitude of aspects relating to study design, analysis, and results, is essential for reliable assessment of study quality, detection of potential biases, and proper interpretation of study findings. Adopting these measures will improve the quality of the body of evidence available for comparative effectiveness research and enhance the ability to establish the clinical utility of prognostic and predictive tumor markers.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McVeigh, Terri Patricia</author><author>Hughes, Lauren M</author><author>Miller, Nicola</author><author>Sheehan, Margaret</author><author>Keane, Maccon</author><author>Sweeney, Karl J</author><author>Kerin, Michael J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of Oncotype DX testing on breast cancer management and chemotherapy prescribing patterns in a tertiary referral centre</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>2763-2770</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0959-8049 1879-0852</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejca.2014.08.002</electronic-resource-num><notes>references

Aims: This study aims to1.Document longitudinal changes in chemotherapy use,2.Assess the impact of new evidence on local protocol. Methods: A cohort study was undertaken, including consecutive patients with early node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and May 2013, including a period of prospective clinical trial (Trial Assigning Individualised Options for Treatment (TAILORx)) recruitment. Data were collected regarding patient demographics, tumour clinico-pathological features, Oncotype DX use and recurrence score and chemotherapy use. All therapeutic decisions were made following multidisciplinary discussion, with adherence to guidelines and consideration of trial protocol and Oncotype DX recurrence scores. Results: 479 consecutive patients were included in the study, of whom 241 (50%) underwent Oncotype DX testing, 97 as part of the TAILORx clinical trial. Oncotype DX testing began on a trial basis in 2007 and until October 2011, only patients enrolled on TAILORx availed of genomic profiling. From October 2011, Oncotype DX was used in all eligible patients as per National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) guidelines. A total of 216 (45%) patients received chemotherapy. The use of chemotherapy changed in inverse proportion to the availability of the genomic assay. Of those patients in whom Oncotype DX was utilised, 138 (57%) were spared chemotherapy. Conclusion: This study validates the use of molecular testing in the rationalisation of systemic therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Milburn, Meghan</author><author>Rosman, Martin</author><author>Mylander, Charles</author><author>Tafra, Lorraine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is Onco type DX Recurrence Score (RS) of Prognostic Value Once HER2-Positive and.

Oncotype DX was validated in cohorts that included poor prognostic factors (HER2-positive, low-estrogen receptor [ER] expression), raising the question: if patients with known high recurrence rates are excluded, is the Recurrence Score (RS) still valid? Our purpose was to determine if RS can be predicted with readily available measures. One hundred and twenty samples from August 2006 to November 2010 that underwent Oncotype DX testing were analyzed. Data included RS, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and Ki67 status by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC data were used to create two linear regression models to predict RS. SAS's JMP-7 was used for statistical analysis. When comparing Oncotype DX- and IHC-derived ER and PR values, there were 21 discordant samples. The linear regression model PRS-F created with IHC data (ER, PR, HER2, Ki67) from all samples (n = 120) had an adjusted R(2) = 0.60 indicating a good model for predicting RS. The PRS-R model was built without low-ER and HER2-positive samples (n = 110). It had an adjusted R(2) = 0.38 indicating poor prediction of RS. Oncotype DX data showed good concordance with IHC for ER- and PR-expression in this cohort. Low-ER samples had high RS. After removing low-ER and HER2-positives, calculating RS with PRS-R from remaining data showed poor predictive power for RS (adjusted R(2) = 0.38). This result questions whether RS is prognostic in this subgroup (who would most benefit from further clarification of recurrence risk) and independent of pathology, or is simply producing random RS values. Data bases available to Genomic Health can resolve this issue.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mislick, Kimberly</author><author>Schonfeld, Warren</author><author>Bodnar, Carolyn</author><author>Tong, Kuo Bianchini</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis of Mammostrat&amp;amp;reg; compared with Oncotype DX&amp;amp;reg; to inform the treatment of breast cancer</title><secondary-title>ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research</full-title></periodical><pages>37</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1178-6981</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2147/CEOR.S53142</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.dovepress.com/cost-effectiveness-analysis-of-mammostratreg-compared-with-oncotype-dx-peer-reviewed-article-CEOR</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;compare-mammostrat;fe-focus-economic;pmc99;pts-simulated</label><abstract>Purpose: To compare the cost-effectiveness of the tumor subtyping assays Mammostrat® and Oncotype DX® for assessing risk of recurrence in early-stage breast cancer and the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a US third-party payer perspective. A 10 year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effects of using each method of risk assessment. The percentages of patients assessed as high, moderate, or low risk were obtained from multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trials. The analysis simulated the experience of women progressing through various model states representing clinical treatments and subsequent disease. Published recurrence data for Mammostrat® were adjusted appropriately to account for differences between definitions and samples of Oncotype DX® and Mammostrat® in the original clinical trials. Cost and utility data were obtained from previously published studies. Sensitivity analyses examined how base-case results might differ when input values and assumptions varied. Results: Base-case costs for women assessed using Mammostrat® were $15,782, compared with $18,051 for women assessed with Oncotype DX®. Thus, cost savings of $2,268 resulted from using Mammostrat®. Both Mammostrat® and Oncotype DX® resulted in similar life years (9.880 and 9.882) and quality-adjusted life years (7.935 and 7.940), respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the assumptions made about recurrence are the key drivers of model results. Discussion: Cost savings associated with the use of Mammostrat® instead of Oncotype DX® are largely due to the difference in cost between the two tests. Since survival and quality-adjusted life years were similar using either assay, Mammostrat® has economic advantages for women with early-stage breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Myers, Meagan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Targeted therapies with companion diagnostics in the management of breast cancer: current perspectives</title><secondary-title>Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>7</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1178-7066</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2147/PGPM.S56055</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.dovepress.com/targeted-therapies-with-companion-diagnostics-in-the-management-of-bre-peer-reviewed-article-PGPM</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;compare-PAM50;compare-mammaprint;pmc99;tos-overview</label><abstract>Breast cancer is a multifaceted disease exhibiting both intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity as well as variable disease course. Over 2 decades of research has advanced the understanding of the molecular substructure of breast cancer, directing the development of new therapeutic strategies against these actionable targets. In vitro diagnostics, and specifically companion diagnostics, have been integral in the successful development and implementation of these targeted therapies, such as those directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Lately, there has been a surge in the development, commercialization, and marketing of diagnostic assays to assist in breast cancer patient care. More recently, multigene signature assays, such as Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, and Prosigna, have been integrated in the clinical setting in order to tailor decisions on adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy treatment.

It was initially believed that PR was a useful diagnostic marker of estrogen receptor activity, but increasingly PR has been recognised to play an important biological role in breast homeostasis, carcinogenesis and metastasis. Although PR expression is almost exclusively observed in estrogen receptor positive tumors, few studies have investigated the cellular mechanisms of PR action in the context of ongoing estrogen signalling. Methods: In this study, we contrast PR function in estrogen pretreated ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells with vehicle treated ZR-75-1 and T-47D breast cancer cells using expression microarrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing. Results: Estrogen cotreatment caused a dramatic increase in the number of genes regulated by progesterone in ZR-75-1 cells.

We sought to better understand health behaviors that early stage breast cancer survivors engage in to reduce recurrence risk. Methods: Data came from a cross-sectional multi-site survey of 186 early-stage breast cancer survivors who received genomic testing for breast cancer recurrence risk (Oncotype DX) during their clinical care. Study outcomes were meeting health behavior recommendations (daily fruit and vegetable intake, regular physical activity, and having a healthy body mass index (BMI)). Results: Approximately three-quarters of survivors we surveyed believed the 3 behaviors might reduce their cancer risk but many did not engage in these behaviors for this purpose: 62% for BMI, 36% for fruit and vegetable consumption, and 37% for physical activity. Survivors with higher recurrence risk, as indicated by their genomic test results, were no more likely to meet any of the three health behavior recommendations. Adherence to health behavior recommendations was higher for women who were white, college-educated, and had higher incomes. Conclusions: Many nonadherent breast cancer survivors wish to use these behavioral strategies to reduce their risk for recurrence, suggesting an important opportunity for intervention. Improving BMI, which has the largest association with cancer risk, is an especially promising target.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oakman, Catherine</author><author>Bessi, Silvia</author><author>Zafarana, Elena</author><author>Galardi, Francesca</author><author>Biganzoli, Laura</author><author>Di Leo, Angelo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recent advances in systemic therapy.

Each patient has a tumour with innate features that dictate their chance of relapse and their responsiveness to treatment. Often patients with similar clinical and pathological tumours will have markedly different outcomes and responses to adjuvant intervention. These differences are encoded in the tumour genetic profile. Effective biomarkers may replace or complement traditional clinical and histopathological markers in assessing tumour behaviour and risk. Development of high-throughput genomic technologies is enabling the study of gene expression profiles of tumours. Genomic fingerprints may refine prediction of the course of disease and response to adjuvant interventions. This review will focus on the role of multiparameter gene expression analyses in early breast cancer, with regards to prognosis and prediction. The prognostic role of genomic signatures, particularly the Mammaprint and Rotterdam signatures, is evolving. With regard to prediction of outcome, the Oncotype Dx multigene assay is in clinical use in tamoxifen treated patients. Extensive research continues on predictive gene identification for specific chemotherapeutic agents, particularly the anthracyclines, taxanes and alkylating agents.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oratz, Ruth</author><author>Kim, Benjamin</author><author>Chao, Calvin</author><author>Skrzypczak, Stanley</author><author>Ory, Caron</author><author>Bugarini, Roberto</author><author>Broder, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Physician Survey of the Effect of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score Assay Results on Treatment Recommendations for Patients With Lymph Node-Positive, Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>94-99</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>1554-7477 1935-469X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JOP.2010.000046</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jop.ascopubs.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JOP.2010.000046</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pmc99;pts-node-pos ER+;tos-discovery;tos-prospective</label><abstract>This physician survey looks at the effect of the 21-gene recurrence score assay results on adjuvant treatment recommendations for patients with lymph node–positive, estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orucevic, Amila</author><author>Heidel, Robert E</author><author>Bell, John L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Utilization and impact of 21-gene recurrence score assay for breast cancer in clinical practice across the United States: lessons learned from the 2010 to 2012 National Cancer Data Base analysis</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</full-title></periodical><pages>427-435</pages><volume>157</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>0167-6806 1573-7217</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10549-016-3833-9</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10549-016-3833-9</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;fuc-focus-usage-of-chemo;fut-focus-usage-of-test;pmc99;tos-cohort</label><abstract>The aim of our study is to investigate patient selection for the 21-gene recurrence score assay (RS) for breast cancer (BC) and the RS impact on chemotherapy administration (Chemo) in clinical practice across the United States through the retrospective observational study of National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) patients from 2010 to 2012. NCDB captures ~70 % of all newly diagnosed malignancies in the USA annually. The 2010–2012 period depicts data from the beginning of the NCDB that required recording of molecular assays and their data release in April 2015. De-identified demographic and clinical variables of patients that had RS results were analyzed. 513,080 patients had BC; 406,525 were estrogen receptor-positive (ER+). 74,334/91,651 patients with RS recorded as a numerical value (0–100) were analyzed (18.2 % of ER+). Patients’ ages ranged from 18 to 90 (mean = 58.8, median = 59); 99.1 % were females. Patients of Caucasian race, from regions with $63,000 median household income were more likely to be tested than patients of other races, education, or income (p &lt; 0.001). 58.1 % of tests were performed in ER+/lymph node-negative/&gt;1 cm tumors; 16.4 % included ≥N1 disease; 9.9 % included T1a, T3, Stage III and IV, or HER2-positive cancers. Low-risk RS result had 92.2 % negative predictive value for no Chemo. Intermediate-risk RS result had 40.1 % positive predictive value (PPV); high-risk RS had 81.2 % PPV for Chemo. RS is obtained in ~1/5 of ER + BC patients across the USA. Further studies investigating influence and implementation of the newest evidence-based management guidelines regarding patients’ selection for RS test and chemotherapy administration upon obtaining of test results are warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ozmen, Vahit</author><author>Atasoy, Ajlan</author><author>Gokmen, Erhan</author><author>Ozdogan, Mustafa</author><author>Guler, Nilufer</author><author>Uras, Cihan</author><author>Ok, Engin</author><author>Demircan, Orhan</author><author>Isikdogan, Abdurrahman</author><author>Saip, Pinar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of Oncotype DX Recurrence Score on Treatment Decisions: Results of a Prospective Multicenter Study in Turkey</title><secondary-title>Cureus</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cureus</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>2168-8184</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7759/cureus.522</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cureus.com/articles/4086-impact-of-oncotype-dx-recurrence-score-on-treatment-decisions-results-of-a-prospective-multicenter-study-in-turkey</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pmc13;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-present;tos-cohort</label><abstract>Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among Turkish women and the rate of early stage disease is increasing.

METHODS: We tested whether the results of a reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 21 prospectively selected genes in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue would correlate with the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with node-negative, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer who were enrolled in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project clinical trial B-14. The levels of expression of 16 cancer-related genes and 5 reference genes were used in a prospectively defined algorithm to calculate a recurrence score and to determine a risk group (low, intermediate, or high) for each patient. RESULTS: Adequate RT-PCR profiles were obtained in 668 of 675 tumor blocks. The proportions of patients categorized as having a low, intermediate, or high risk by the RT-PCR assay were 51, 22, and 27 percent, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of distant recurrence at 10 years in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 6.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4.0 to 9.6), 14.3 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 8.3 to 20.3), and 30.5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23.6 to 37.4). The rate in the low-risk group was significantly lower than that in the high-risk group (P&lt;0.001). In a multivariate Cox model, the recurrence score provided significant predictive power that was independent of age and tumor size (P&lt;0.001). The recurrence score was also predictive of overall survival (P&lt;0.001) and could be used as a continuous function to predict distant recurrence in individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: The recurrence score has been validated as quantifying the likelihood of distant recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients with node-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paik, Soonmyung</author><author>Tang, Gong</author><author>Shak, Steven</author><author>Kim, C.</author><author>Baker, Joffre</author><author>Kim, Wanseop</author><author>Cronin, Maureen</author><author>Baehner, Frederick L</author><author>Watson, Drew</author><author>Bryant, John</author><author>Costantino, Joseph P</author><author>Geyer, Charles E</author><author>Wickerham, D Lawrence</author><author>Wolmark, Norman</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gene Expression and Benefit of Chemotherapy in Women With Node-Negative, Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>3726-3734</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols: ad</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols: th</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biological: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin</keyword><keyword>Cisplatin: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Estrogen</keyword><keyword>Estrogen: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil</keyword><keyword>Fluorouracil: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Regulation</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Linear Models</keyword><keyword>Local</keyword><keyword>Local: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Local: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Methotrexate</keyword><keyword>Methotrexate: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Mitomycins</keyword><keyword>Mitomycins: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Proteins: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Neoplastic</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Proportional Hazards Models</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Recurrence: prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen</keyword><keyword>Tamoxifen: administration &amp; dosage</keyword><keyword>Tumor Markers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><accession-num>16720680</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JCO.2005.04.7985</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16720680</url><url>http://www.jco.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JCO.2005.04.7985</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;NNT paper;Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;em-distant recurrence 10 years;fpb-focus-patient benefit;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay quantifies the likelihood of distant recurrence in women with estrogen receptor-positive, lymph node-negative breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.

We generated prognostic models that incorporate protein-based molecular markers and clinico-pathological variables to improve survival prediction. Methods: We used a quantitative immunofluorescence method to study protein expression of 14 markers included in the Oncotype DX™ assay on a 638 breast cancer patient cohort with 15-year follow-up. We performed cross-validation analyses to assess performance of multivariate Cox models consisting of these markers and standard clinico-pathological covariates, using an average time-dependent Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves and compared it to nested Cox models obtained by robust backward selection procedures. Results: A prognostic index derived from of a multivariate Cox regression model incorporating molecular and clinico-pathological covariates (nodal status, tumor size, nuclear grade, and age) is superior to models based on molecular studies alone or clinico-pathological covariates alone. Performance of this composite model can be further improved using feature selection techniques to prune variables. When stratifying patients by Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI), the most prognostic markers in high and low NPI groups differed. Similarly, for the node-negative, hormone receptor-positive sub-population, we derived a compact model with three clinico-pathological variables and two protein markers that was superior to the full model. Conclusions: Prognostic models that include both molecular and clinico-pathological covariates can be more accurate than models based on either set of features alone. Furthermore, feature selection can decrease the number of molecular variables needed to predict outcome, potentially resulting in less expensive assays.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Partin, Jessica F</author><author>Mamounas, Eleftherios P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of the 21-gene recurrence score assay compared with standard clinicopathologic guidelines in adjuvant therapy selection for node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.</title><secondary-title>Annals of surgical oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of surgical oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>3399-406</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Adjuvant</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols</keyword><keyword>Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols: th</keyword><keyword>Biological</keyword><keyword>Biological: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: pathology</keyword><keyword>Chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>Estrogen</keyword><keyword>Estrogen: analysis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Local</keyword><keyword>Local: drug therapy</keyword><keyword>Local: genetics</keyword><keyword>Local: pathology</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes: pathology</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Invasiveness</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Neoplasm Staging</keyword><keyword>Practice Guidelines as Topic</keyword><keyword>Progesterone</keyword><keyword>Progesterone: analysis</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Receptor</keyword><keyword>Receptors</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Tumor Markers</keyword><keyword>erbB-2</keyword><keyword>erbB-2: analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><accession-num>21537874</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1245/s10434-011-1698-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21537874</url></web-urls></urls><label>JULIA;Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;done;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>The development of multigene assays has proved useful in the clinical management of early-stage breast cancer.

We used the 21-gene assay to examine the association of quantitative HER2 messenger RNA (mRNA) gene expression and benefit from trastuzumab. Methods: N9831 tested the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in stage I–III HER2-positive breast cancer. For two of the arms of the trial, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC-T) and doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel and trastuzumab concurrent chemotherapy-trastuzumab (AC-TH), recurrence score (RS) and HER2 mRNA expression were determined by the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX®) (negative &lt;10.7, equivocal 10.7 to &lt;11.5, and positive ≥11.5 log2 expression units). Cox regression was used to assess the association of HER2 expression with trastuzumab benefit in preventing distant recurrence. Results: Median follow-up was 7.4 years. Of 1,940 total patients, 901 had consent and sufficient tissue. HER2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was negative in 130 (14 %), equivocal in 85 (9 %), and positive in 686 (76 %) patients. Concordance between HER2 assessments was 95 % for RT-PCR versus central immunohistochemistry (IHC) (&gt;10 % positive cells = positive), 91 % for RT-PCR versus central fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (≥2.0 = positive) and 94 % for central IHC versus central FISH. In the primary analysis, the association of HER2 expression by 21-gene assay with trastuzumab benefit was marginally nonsignificant (nonlinear p = 0.057). In hormone receptor-positive patients (local IHC) the association was significant (p = 0.002).

In this study, we evaluated the ability of six clinically relevant genomic signatures to predict relapse in patients with ER+ tumors treated with adjuvant tamoxifen only. Methods: Four microarray datasets were combined and research-based versions of PAM50 intrinsic subtyping and risk of relapse (PAM50-ROR) score, 21-gene recurrence score (OncotypeDX), Mammaprint, Rotterdam 76 gene, index of sensitivity to endocrine therapy (SET) and an estrogen-induced gene set were evaluated. Distant relapse-free survival (DRFS) was estimated by Kaplan–Meier and log-rank tests, and multivariable analyses were done using Cox regression analysis. Harrell's C-index was also used to estimate performance. Results: All signatures were prognostic in patients with ER+ node-negative tumors, whereas most were prognostic in ER+ node-positive disease. Among the signatures evaluated, PAM50-ROR, OncotypeDX, Mammaprint and SET were consistently found to be independent predictors of relapse. A combination of all signatures significantly increased the performance prediction. Importantly, low-risk tumors (&gt;90% DRFS at 8.5 years) were identified by the majority of signatures only within node-negative disease, and these tumors were mostly luminal A (78%–100%). Conclusions: Most established genomic signatures were successful in outcome predictions in ER+ breast cancer and provided statistically independent information. From a clinical perspective, multiple signatures combined together most accurately predicted outcome, but a common finding was that each signature identified a subset of luminal A patients with node-negative disease who might be considered suitable candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy alone.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramsey, Scott D</author><author>Barlow, William E</author><author>Gonzalez-Angulo, Ana M</author><author>Tunis, Sean</author><author>Baker, Laurence</author><author>Crowley, John</author><author>Deverka, Patricia</author><author>Veenstra, David</author><author>Hortobagyi, Gabriel N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrating comparative effectiveness design elements and endpoints into a phase III, randomized clinical trial (SWOG S1007) evaluating oncotypeDX-guided management for women with breast cancer involving lymph nodes.</title><secondary-title>Contemporary clinical trials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contemporary clinical trials</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: secondary</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: therapy</keyword><keyword>Clinical Trials</keyword><keyword>Combined Modality Therapy</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes</keyword><keyword>Lymph Nodes: pathology</keyword><keyword>Lymphatic Metastasis</keyword><keyword>Phase III as Topic</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic</keyword><keyword>Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic: methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><accession-num>23000081</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cct.2012.09.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ramsey et al. - 2013 - Integrating comparative effectiveness design elements and endpoints into a phase III, randomized clinical trial (.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3525786&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;compare-RxPONDER;done;fe-focus-economic;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;tos-prospective</label><abstract>Women with breast cancer involving the lymph nodes are typically treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Retrospective evaluations of prior studies suggest that the 21-gene test (OncotypeDX®), may allow identification of those who can safely avoid chemotherapy. To better understand the performance of the 21-gene test, the RxPONDER (Rx for Positive Node, Endocrine Responsive breast cancer) study was designed, a multicenter Phase III trial randomizing women with hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer involving 1-3 lymph nodes and a 21-gene assay recurrence score (RS) of 25 or less to endocrine therapy alone versus chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy. As one of the first large-scale comparative-effectiveness studies in oncology, RxPONDER utilized an external stakeholder group to help inform the design of the trial. Stakeholders met with representatives of SWOG over several months through a structured discussion process. The stakeholder engagement process resulted in several changes being made to the trial design. In addition, stakeholder representatives from the health insurance industry provided guidance regarding a mechanism whereby the costs of OncotypeDX® would be paid by the majority of health insurers as part of the trial. The process may serve as a template for future studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness of genomic tests in oncology, particularly those that are conducted within cooperative clinical trials groups.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reed, Shelby D</author><author>Dinan, Michaela A</author><author>Schulman, Kevin A</author><author>Lyman, Gary H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cost-effectiveness of the 21-gene recurrence score assay in the context of multifactorial decision making to guide chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer</title><secondary-title>Genetics in Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Genetics in Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>203-211</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1098-3600 1530-0366</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/gim.2012.119</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/gim.2012.119</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fe-focus-economic;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Purpose: New evidence is available regarding the utility of the 21-gene Recurrence Score (RS) assay in guiding chemotherapy use for node-negative, estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer. We applied this evidence in a decision-analytic model to reevaluate the cost-effectiveness of the assay. Methods: We cross-classified patients by clinicopathologic characteristics from the Adjuvant! risk index and by RS risk group. For non–RS-guided treatment, we assumed patients receiving hormonal therapy alone had low-risk characteristics and patients receiving chemotherapy and hormonal therapy had higher-risk characteristics. For RS-guided treatment, we assigned chemotherapy probabilities conditional on RS risk group and clinicopathologic characteristics. Results: An estimated 40.4% of patients in the RS-guided strategy and 47.3% in the non–RS-guided strategy were expected to receive chemotherapy. The incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.28) with the RS-guided strategy. Lifetime medical costs to the health system were $2692 ($1546 to $3821) higher with the RS-guided strategy, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $16,677/QALY ($7613 to $37,219). From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness was $10,788/QALY ($6840 to $30,265). Conclusion: The findings provide supportive evidence for the economic value of the 21-gene RS assay in node-negative, estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rouzier, Roman</author><author>Pronzato, Paolo</author><author>Chéreau, Elisabeth</author><author>Carlson, Josh</author><author>Hunt, Barnaby</author><author>Valentine, William J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multigene assays and molecular markers in breast cancer: systematic review of health economic analyses.</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</full-title></periodical><pages>621-637</pages><volume>139</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Biological Markers</keyword><keyword>Biological Markers: analysis</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: economics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: genetics</keyword><keyword>Breast Neoplasms: metabolism</keyword><keyword>Cost-Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling</keyword><keyword>Gene Expression Profiling: economics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1054901325</isbn><accession-num>23722312</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10549-013-2559-1</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://10549_2013_Article_2559.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=3695325&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract</url></web-urls></urls><label>JULIA;Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;done;economic focus;fe-focus-economic;pmc99;tos-overview</label><abstract>Breast cancer is the most common female cancer and is associated with a significant clinical and economic burden. Multigene assays and molecular markers represent an opportunity to direct chemotherapy only to patients likely to have significant benefit. This systematic review examines published health economic analyses to assess the support for adjuvant therapy decision making. Literature searches of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and congress databases were carried out to identify economic evaluations of multigene assays and molecular markers published between 2002 and 2012. After screening and data extraction, study quality was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies instrument. The review identified 29 publications that reported evaluations of two assays: Oncotype DX(®) and MammaPrint. Studies of both tests provided evidence that their routine use was cost saving or cost-effective versus conventional approaches. Benefits were driven by optimal allocation of adjuvant chemotherapy and reduction in chemotherapy utilization. Findings were sensitive to variation in the frequency of chemotherapy prescription, chemotherapy costs, and patients' risk profiles. Evidence suggests that multigene assays are likely cost saving or cost-effective relative to current approaches to adjuvant therapy. They should benefit decision making in early-stage breast cancer in a variety of settings worldwide.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sahebjam, S</author><author>Aloyz, R</author><author>Pilavdzic, D</author><author>Brisson, M.-L.</author><author>Ferrario, C</author><author>Bouganim, N</author><author>Cohen, V</author><author>Miller, W H</author><author>Panasci, L C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ki 67 is a major, but not the sole determinant of Oncotype Dx recurrence score</title><secondary-title>British Journal of Cancer</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British Journal of Cancer</full-title></periodical><pages>1342-1345</pages><volume>105</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>0007-0920 1532-1827</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/bjc.2011.402</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/bjc.2011.402</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;compare-Ki67;done;em-risk of recurrence;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc13;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Background:: Immunohistological assessment of Ki 67 expression is less expensive than Oncotype Dx, which is currently used to identify patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer, who will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

In these studies PR was assessed by methods that measure protein content. Oncotype Dx measures mRNA expression. In clinical trials the discrepancy between IHC and RT PCR for the expression of PR was about 20%, but this was not assessed in a community setting. The meaning of high levels of PR mRNA without detectable PR protein is unclear. This discrepancy might result from technical issues or might be explained by a biological mechanism such as translational inhibition of PR by miRNA’s. We sought to verify the prognostic value of the expression of the progesterone receptor by IHC in women with early stage HER 2 negative, ER positive BC treated with systemic hormonal therapy only at our institution. Next, we aimed to characterize the results of Oncotype Dx in ER positive, PR negative HER 2 negative tumors. Methods: 1st cohort: Files of consecutive patients with ER positive HER 2 negative tumors that were treated by adjuvant hormonal treatment during 2000–2006 were reviewed. 2nd cohort: The characteristics of PR negative tumors tested by Oncotype Dx during 2007–2011 were analyzed. Results: 1st cohort: 286 patients’ files were reviewed. 82% of tumors were node negative. 80 were PR negative and 209 were PR positive. No significant differences existed between the groups with respect to nodal involvement or grade. After a median follow up of 7.24 years (0.78 to 9.5) 8 women with PR negative and 9 women with PR positive tumors experienced disease recurrence (10% vs 4.3%, RR 2.32, p 0.014 by univariant analyses). 33% of patients (5 out of 15) with grade 3 PR negative tumors experienced recurrence. 2nd cohort: 81 PR negative tumors were included. The rate of discordance between IHC and Oncotype Dx for PR expression was 47.3%. Recurrence scores were: 50% intermediate risk, 32.5% low risk and 17.5% high risk. Grade 3 tumors were more likely to be high risk (37.5%) and PR negative by RT PCR (84.6%). Conclusion: In our hands PR negative tumors carry a worse prognosis when treated by hormonal adjuvant treatment compared with ER/PR positive tumors. We found a high rate of discrepancy between IHC and RT PCR concerning PR expression. Most PR negative tumors are labeled intermediate risk. The value of the test in this setting is unclear. 310</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Siegelmann-Danieli, Nava</author><author>Silverman, Barbara</author><author>Zick, Aviad</author><author>Beit-Or, Anat</author><author>Katzir, Itzhak</author><author>Porath, Avi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score on treatment decisions and clinical outcomes in patients with early breast cancer: the Maccabi Healthcare Services experience with a unified testing policy</title><secondary-title>ecancermedicalscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ecancermedicalscience</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1754-6605</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3332/ecancer.2013.380</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ecancer.org/journal/7/full/380-the-impact-of-the-oncotype-dx-recurrence-score-on-treatment-decisions-and-clinical-outcomes-in-patients-with-early-breast-cancer-the-maccabi-healthcare-services-experience-with-a-unified-testing-policy.php</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;tos-retrospective;tos-cohort</label><abstract>The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score is a validated prognosticator in oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. Our retrospective analysis of a prospectively defined cohort summarises the clinical implications associated with Oncotype DX testing according to the Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS) policy. The MHS eligibility criteria for testing included ER+ N0/pN1mic invasive tumours, discussion of test implications with an oncologist, ductal carcinoma 0.6–1 cm Grade 2–3, HER2 negative ductal carcinomas with 1.1–4.0 cm Grade 1–2, or lobular carcinoma. Large (&gt; 1 cm) Grade 3 tumours could have grade reassessed. We linked Recurrence Score results with patients’ information and used chi-squared tests to assess the associations thereof. Between January 2008 and December 2011, tests were performed on 751 patients (MHS-eligible, 713); 54%, 38%, and 8% of patients had low, intermediate, and high Recurrence Score results, respectively. Recurrence Score distribution varied significantly with age (P = 0.002), with increasing Recurrence Score values with decreasing age. The proportion of patients with high Recurrence Score results varied by grade/size combination and histology, occurring in 32% of small (≤ 1 cm) Grade 3 and 3% of larger (1.1–4 cm) Grade 1 ductal tumours and only in 2% of lobular carcinomas. Chemotherapy was administered to 1%, 13%, and 61% of patients with low, intermediate, and high Recurrence Score results, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001), but only to 2% of intermediate score patients ≥ 65 years. Luteinising-hormone-releasing hormone agonists with tamoxifen were used in 27% of low Recurrence Score patients ≤ 50 years. With a median follow-up of 26 months, no systemic recurrences were documented, whereas four patients exhibited locoregional recurrences. In summary, in this low-to-moderate risk patient population, testing identified 46% of patients as intermediate/high risk. Treatment decisions were influenced by Recurrence Score results and patients’ age. The current MHS policy seems to achieve the goal of promoting chemotherapy use according to the test results in a prespecified patient population.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sinn, P</author><author>Aulmann, S</author><author>Wirtz, R</author><author>Schott, S</author><author>Marmé, F</author><author>Varga, Z</author><author>Lebeau, A</author><author>Kreipe, H</author><author>Schneeweiss, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multigene Assays for Classification, Prognosis, and Prediction in Breast Cancer: a Critical Review on the Background and Clinical Utility</title><secondary-title>Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde</full-title></periodical><pages>932-940</pages><volume>73</volume><issue>09</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0016-5751 1438-8804</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1055/s-0033-1350831</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0033-1350831</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;notrelevant;pmc99</label><abstract>Gene signatures which are based on multigene profiling assays have been developed for the purpose to better define the prognosis and prediction of therapy results in early-stage breast cancer.

Methods: The Oncotype DX breast cancer assay was performed for patients with DCIS treated with surgical excision without radiation in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E5194 study. The association of the prospectively defined DCIS Score (calculated from seven cancer-related genes and five reference genes) with the risk of developing an IBE was analyzed using Cox regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: There were 327 patients with adequate tissue for analysis. The continuous DCIS Score was statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing an IBE (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.15 to 4.49; P = .02) when adjusted for tamoxifen use (prespecified primary analysis) and with invasive IBE (unadjusted HR = 3.68, 95% CI = 1.34 to 9.62; P = .01). For the prespecified DCIS risk groups of low, intermediate, and high, the 10-year risks of developing an IBE were 10.6%, 26.7%, and 25.9%, respectively, and for an invasive IBE, 3.7%, 12.3%, and 19.2%, respectively (both log rank P ≤ .006). In multivariable analyses, factors associated with IBE risk were DCIS Score, tumor size, and menopausal status (all P ≤ .02). Conclusions: The DCIS Score quantifies IBE risk and invasive IBE risk, complements traditional clinical and pathologic factors, and provides a new clinical tool to improve selecting individualized treatment for women with DCIS who meet the ECOG E5194 criteria.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sparano, Joseph A</author><author>Goldstein, Lori J</author><author>Childs, Barrett H</author><author>Shak, Steven</author><author>Brassard, Diana</author><author>Badve, Sunil</author><author>Baehner, Frederick L</author><author>Bugarini, Roberto</author><author>Rowley, Steve</author><author>Perez, Edith</author><author>Shulman, Lawrence N</author><author>Martino, Silvana</author><author>Davidson, Nancy E</author><author>Sledge, George W</author><author>Gray, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Relationship between Topoisomerase 2A RNA Expression and Recurrence after Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Clinical Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>7693-7700</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>24</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><isbn>1078-0432 1078-0432</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1450</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1450</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;compare-novel;done;em-hazard ratio;em-recurrence;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;tissue-past;tos-RCT;tos-case control;tos-discovery</label><abstract>Purpose: To perform an exploratory analysis of the relationship between gene expression and recurrence in operable hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy. Experimental Design: RNA was extracted from archived tumor samples derived from 378 patients with stage I–III HR-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer and analyzed by RT-PCR for a panel of 374 genes, including the 21 gene Recurrence Score (RS). Patients were randomized to receive adjuvant doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide or docetaxel in trial E2197, with no difference in recurrence seen in the treatment arms. All available recurrent cases were selected plus a non-recurrent cohort. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify relationships between gene expression and recurrence. Results: TOP2A expression exhibited the strongest association with increased recurrence risk (p=0.01), and was significantly associated with recurrence (p=0.008) in a multivariate analysis adjusted for clinicopathological features. Elevated TOP2A expression above the median was associated with a 2.6-fold increase (95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.3, 5.2 p=0.008) in risk of recurrence if the RS was less than 18, and a 2.0-fold increase (95% CI, 1.2, 3.2, p=0.003) if there was an intermediate RS of 18–30. Conclusions: In patients with HR-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer, a population known to have a low incidence of TOP2A gene alterations thought to be predictive of anthracycline benefit, there is a range of TOP2A RNA expression that is strongly associated with recurrence after adjuvant anthracyclines which provides information complementary to RS, indicating that it merits further evaluation as a prognostic and predictive marker.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sparano, Joseph A.</author><author>Gray, Robert J.</author><author>Makower, Della F.</author><author>Pritchard, Kathleen I.</author><author>Albain, Kathy S.</author><author>Hayes, Daniel F.</author><author>Geyer, Charles E.</author><author>Dees, Elizabeth C.</author><author>Perez, Edith A.</author><author>Olson, John A.</author><author>Zujewski, JoAnne A</author><author>Lively, Tracy</author><author>Badve, Sunil S.</author><author>Saphner, Thomas J.</author><author>Wagner, Lynne I.</author><author>Whelan, Timothy J.</author><author>Ellis, Matthew J.</author><author>Paik, Soonmyung</author><author>Wood, William C.</author><author>Ravdin, Peter</author><author>Keane, Maccon M.</author><author>Gomez Moreno, Henry L.</author><author>Reddy, Pavan S.</author><author>Goggins, Timothy F.</author><author>Mayer, Ingrid A.</author><author>Brufsky, Adam M.</author><author>Toppmeyer, Deborah L.</author><author>Kaklamani, Virginia G.</author><author>Atkins, James N.</author><author>Berenberg, Jeffrey L.</author><author>Sledge, George W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prospective Validation of a 21-Gene Expression Assay in Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>2005-2014</pages><volume>373</volume><issue>21</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0028-4793 1533-4406</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa1510764</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://nejmoa1510764.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa1510764</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;OncotypeDX_EM;done;em-5-year recurrence rate;em-recurrence free survival;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;interesting;pmc99;pts-HR+;tissue-past;tos-prospective</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Prior studies with the use of a prospective–retrospective design including archival tumor samples have shown that gene-expression assays provide clinically useful prognostic information. However, a prospectively conducted study in a uniformly treated population provides the highest level of evidence supporting the clinical validity and usefulness of a biomarker. METHODS: We performed a prospective trial involving women with hormone-receptor–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)–negative, axillary node–negative breast cancer with tumors of 1.1 to 5.0 cm in the greatest dimension (or 0.6 to 1.0 cm in the greatest dimension and intermediate or high tumor grade) who met established guidelines for the consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features. A reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction assay of 21 genes was performed on the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, and the results were used to calculate a score indicating the risk of breast-cancer recurrence; patients were assigned to receive endocrine therapy without chemotherapy if they had a recurrence score of 0 to 10, indicating a very low risk of recurrence (on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of recurrence). RESULTS: Of the 10,253 eligible women enrolled, 1626 women (15.9%) who had a recurrence score of 0 to 10 were assigned to receive endocrine therapy alone without chemotherapy. At 5 years, in this patient population, the rate of invasive disease–free survival was 93.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.4 to 94.9), the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.7 to 99.6), the rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant or local–regional site was 98.7% (95% CI, 97.9 to 99.2), and the rate of overall survival was 98.0% (95% CI, 97.1 to 98.6). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with hormone-receptor–positive, HER2-negative, axillary node–negative breast cancer who met established guidelines for the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of clinicopathologic features, those with tumors that had a favorable gene-expression profile had very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy alone.

This study sought to examine medical and surgical oncologists’ perceptions of factors related to the translation and integration of Oncotype DX® into routine clinical care. Methods: Twenty oncologists (10 medical and 10 surgical oncologists) participated in qualitative interviews. Questions centered on the following themes: oncologists’ perceptions about the clinical utility of testing, the impact of patient preferences on the decision to test and use results to inform treatment decisions, methods of communicating risk associated with test results to patients, and benefits of and barriers to incorporating testing into multidisciplinary care settings. Results: Oncologists found Oncotype DX® test results useful in their practice, but had concerns as well. These included that some oncologists either used testing inappropriately or placed undue emphasis on the results at the expense of other clinical information. The use of intermediate test results, which have less clear clinical implications, incorporating results with patient treatment preferences, and the use of testing in multidisciplinary teams were noted as specific challenges. Conclusion: Oncologists noted several benefits of testing, but also many challenges, despite wide dissemination and common use. Education for health providers should include specific training in how to interpret and communicate the uncertainty inherent in genomic tests while integrating patient preferences to inform treatment decision making.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stearns, Vered</author><author>Jacobs, Lisa K</author><author>Fackler, MaryJo</author><author>Tsangaris, Theodore N</author><author>Rudek, Michelle A</author><author>Higgins, Michaela</author><author>Lange, Julie</author><author>Cheng, Zandra</author><author>Slater, Shannon A</author><author>Jeter, Stacie C</author><author>Powers, Penny</author><author>Briest, Susanne</author><author>Chao, Calvin</author><author>Yoshizawa, Carl</author><author>Sugar, Elizabeth</author><author>Espinoza-Delgado, Igor</author><author>Sukumar, Saraswati</author><author>Gabrielson, Edward</author><author>Davidson, Nancy E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biomarker Modulation following Short-Term Vorinostat in Women with Newly Diagnosed Primary Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>Clinical Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>4008-4016</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1078-0432</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0033</electronic-resource-num><notes>Clinical Utility : net benefit of test in improving health outcomes.</notes><research-notes>Clinical Utility : net benefit of test in improving health outcomes.</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0033</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;em-hazard ratio;fpb-focus-patient benefit from chemo;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;interesting;pmc99;tos-overview</label><abstract>Purpose: Agents that target the epigenome demonstrate activity in breast cancer models. In preclinical studies, the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and differentiation. We evaluated biomarker modulation in breast cancer tissues obtained from women with newly-diagnosed invasive disease who received vorinostat and those who did not. Experimental Design: Tumor specimens were collected from 25 women who received up to 6 doses of oral vorinostat 300 mg twice daily and from 25 untreated controls in a non-randomized study. Candidate gene expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using the Oncotype DX® 21-gene assay, and by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 and cleaved caspase-3. Matched samples from treated women were analyzed for gene methylation by QM-MSP. Wilcoxon non-parametric tests were used to compare changes in quantitative gene expression levels pre- and post-vorinostat with changes in expression in untreated controls, and changes in gene methylation between pre- and post-vorinostat samples. Results: Vorinostat was well-tolerated and there were no study-related delays in treatment. Compared to untreated controls, there were statistically significant decreases in the expression of proliferation-associated genes Ki-67 (p=0.003), STK15 (p=0.005), and Cyclin B1 (p=0.03) following vorinostat, but not in other genes by the Oncotype DX® assay, or in expression of Ki-67 or cleaved caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry. Changes in methylation were not observed. Conclusions: Short term vorinostat administration is associated with a significant decrease in expression of proliferation-associated genes in untreated breast cancers. This demonstration of biological activity supports investigation of vorinostat in combination with other agents for the management of breast cancer.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stein, Robert C</author><author>Dunn, Janet A</author><author>Bartlett, John Ms</author><author>Campbell, Amy F</author><author>Marshall, Andrea</author><author>Hall, Peter</author><author>Rooshenas, Leila</author><author>Morgan, Adrienne</author><author>Poole, Christopher</author><author>Pinder, Sarah E</author><author>Cameron, David A</author><author>Stallard, Nigel</author><author>Donovan, Jenny L</author><author>McCabe, Christopher</author><author>Hughes-Davies, Luke</author><author>Makris, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>OPTIMA prelim: a randomised feasibility study of personalised care in the treatment of women with early breast cancer</title><secondary-title>Health Technology Assessment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health Technology Assessment</full-title></periodical><pages>1-202</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><isbn>1366-5278 2046-4924</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3310/hta20100</electronic-resource-num><notes>feasibility study planning an RCT to assess Oncotype DX.

Multiparameter assays that measure the expression of several tumour genes simultaneously have been developed to guide the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for this breast cancer subtype. The assays provide prognostic information and have been claimed to predict chemotherapy sensitivity. There is a dearth of prospective validation studies. The Optimal Personalised Treatment of early breast cancer usIng Multiparameter Analysis preliminary study (OPTIMA prelim) is the feasibility phase of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to validate the use of multiparameter assay directed chemotherapy decisions in the NHS. OBJECTIVES: OPTIMA prelim was designed to establish the acceptability to patients and clinicians of randomisation to test-driven treatment assignment compared with usual care and to select an assay for study in the main RCT. DESIGN: Partially blinded RCT with adaptive design. SETTING: Thirty-five UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 40 years with surgically treated ER-positive HER2-negative primary breast cancer and with 1-9 involved axillary nodes, or, if node negative, a tumour at least 30 mm in diameter. INTERVENTIONS: Randomisation between two treatment options. Option 1 was standard care consisting of chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy. In option 2, an Oncotype DX(®) test (Genomic Health Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) performed on the resected tumour was used to assign patients either to standard care [if 'recurrence score' (RS) was &gt; 25] or to endocrine therapy alone (if RS was ≤ 25). Patients allocated chemotherapy were blind to their randomisation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The pre-specified success criteria were recruitment of 300 patients in no longer than 2 years and, for the final 150 patients, (1) an acceptance rate of at least 40%; (2) recruitment taking no longer than 6 months; and (3) chemotherapy starting within 6 weeks of consent in at least 85% of patients. RESULTS: Between September 2012 and 3 June 2014, 350 patients consented to join OPTIMA prelim and 313 were randomised; the final 150 patients were recruited in 6 months, of whom 92% assigned chemotherapy started treatment within 6 weeks. The acceptance rate for the 750 patients invited to participate was 47%. Twelve out of the 325 patients with data (3.7%, 95% confidence interval 1.7% to 5.8%) were deemed ineligible on central review of receptor status. Interviews with researchers and recordings of potential participant consultations made as part of the integral qualitative recruitment study provided insights into recruitment barriers and led to interventions designed to improve recruitment. Patient information was changed as the result of feedback from three patient focus groups. Additional multiparameter analysis was performed on 302 tumour samples. Although Oncotype DX, MammaPrint(®)/BluePrint(®) (Agendia Inc., Irvine, CA, USA), Prosigna(®) (NanoString Technologies Inc., Seattle, WA, USA), IHC4, IHC4 automated quantitative immunofluorescence (AQUA(®)) [NexCourse BreastTM (Genoptix Inc. Carlsbad, CA, USA)] and MammaTyper(®) (BioNTech Diagnostics GmbH, Mainz, Germany) categorised comparable numbers of tumours into low- or high-risk groups and/or equivalent molecular subtypes, there was only moderate agreement between tests at an individual tumour level (kappa ranges 0.33-0.60 and 0.39-0.55 for tests providing risks and subtypes, respectively). Health economics modelling showed the value of information to the NHS from further research into multiparameter testing is high irrespective of the test evaluated. Prosigna is currently the highest priority for further study. CONCLUSIONS: OPTIMA prelim has achieved its aims of demonstrating that a large UK clinical trial of multiparameter assay-based selection of chemotherapy in hormone-sensitive early breast cancer is feasible. The economic analysis shows that a trial would be economically worthwhile for the NHS. Based on the outcome of the OPTIMA prelim, a large-scale RCT to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiparameter assay-directed chemotherapy decisions in hormone-sensitive</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stemmer, Salomon M</author><author>Klang, Shmuel H</author><author>Ben-Baruch, Noa</author><author>Geffen, David B</author><author>Steiner, Mariana</author><author>Soussan-Gutman, Lior</author><author>Merling, Shahar</author><author>Svedman, Christer</author><author>Rizel, Shulamith</author><author>Lieberman, Nicky</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The impact of the 21-gene Recurrence Score assay on clinical decision-making in node-positive (up to 3 positive nodes) estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</full-title></periodical><pages>83-92</pages><volume>140</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>0167-6806 1573-7217</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10549-013-2603-1</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10549-013-2603-1</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;em-odds ratio;fpb-focus-patient benefit from oncotype;ftd-focus-treatment decision change;pmc99;pts-node-pos ER+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Oncotype DX testing is reimbursed in Israel for node-negative and node-positive (N1+; up to 3 positive nodes including micrometastases), estrogen receptor positive (ER+), breast cancer patients. This retrospective study evaluated the impact of Oncotype DX testing on treatment decisions in N1+/ER+ breast cancer patients. To this end, we compared treatments for all N+ patients for whom testing had been ordered with treatments for patients with similar characteristics where the test had not been available. The retrospective analysis included 951 patients (282 Oncotype DX, 669 controls), all of whom received endocrine therapy with or without chemotherapy. In Oncotype DX patients, 7.1, 37.0, and 100 % of those with low, intermediate, and high Recurrence Score results (Oncotype DX summary score) received chemotherapy, respectively (P &lt; 0.0001, all comparisons). Chemotherapy use was lower in Oncotype DX patients versus controls (24.5 vs. 70.1 %). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis in which the probability of receiving chemotherapy was modeled as a function of Oncotype DX testing, age, tumor size, tumor grade, nodal status, and the interactions between Oncotype DX testing and the other covariates, Oncotype DX testing was associated with significantly lower odds of receiving chemotherapy (odds ratio 0.16; 95 % CI 0.11–0.24; P &lt; 0.0001). In summary, our findings suggest that Oncotype DX testing has a significant impact on reducing chemotherapy use in N1+/ER+ breast cancer patients in Israel.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sturgeon, Catharine M.</author><author>Hoffman, Barry R.</author><author>Chan, Daniel W.</author><author>Ch'ng, S.-L.</author><author>Hammond, Elizabeth</author><author>Hayes, Daniel F.</author><author>Liotta, Lance A.</author><author>Petricoin, Emmanuel F.</author><author>Schmitt, Manfred</author><author>Semmes, O.

Few studies have assessed the impact of testing on patient-reported outcomes such as cancer-related distress or quality of life. The few studies that have assessed these outcomes do not consider potential modifiers, such as the patients’ level of involvement in the treatment decision-making process. In the current study, 81 breast cancer patients who received the RS assay completed cross-sectional surveys. We used linear multiple regression to assess whether test result, decision-making role (passive versus shared/active), and their interaction contributed to current levels of distress, quality of life, and decisional conflict. There were no associations between these variables and test result or decision-making role. However, women who received an intermediate RS and took a passive role in their care reported higher-cancer-related distress and cancer worry and lower quality of life than those who took a shared or active role. These data should be confirmed in prospective samples, as these poorer outcomes could be amenable to intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sutton, Elizabeth J</author><author>Oh, Jung Hun</author><author>Dashevsky, Brittany Z</author><author>Veeraraghavan, Harini</author><author>Apte, Aditya P</author><author>Thakur, Sunitha B</author><author>Deasy, Joseph O</author><author>Morris, Elizabeth A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breast cancer subtype intertumor heterogeneity: MRI-based features predict results of a genomic assay</title><secondary-title>Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging</full-title></periodical><pages>1398-1406</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1053-1807 1522-2586</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmri.24890</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/jmri.24890</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;pts-ER+;pts-HER2-;pts-PR+;tos-case control;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Purpose: To investigate the association between a validated, gene-expression-based, aggressiveness assay, Oncotype Dx RS, and morphological and texture-based image features extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods: This retrospective study received Internal Review Board approval and need for informed consent was waived. Between 2006–2012, we identified breast cancer patients with: 1) ER+, PR+, and HER2− invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC); 2) preoperative breast MRI; and 3) Oncotype Dx RS test results. Extracted features included morphological, histogram, and gray-scale correlation matrix (GLCM)-based texture features computed from tumors contoured on pre- and three postcontrast MR images. Linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between Oncotype Dx RS and different clinical, pathologic, and imaging features. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Ninety-five patients with IDC were included with a median Oncotype Dx RS of 16 (range: 0–45). Using stepwise multiple linear regression modeling, two MR-derived image features, kurtosis in the first and third postcontrast images and histologic nuclear grade, were found to be significantly correlated with the Oncotype Dx RS with P = 0.0056, 0.0005, and 0.0105, respectively. The overall model resulted in statistically significant correlation with Oncotype Dx RS with an R-squared value of 0.23 (adjusted R-squared = 0.20; P = 0.0002) and a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.49 (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: A model for IDC using imaging and pathology information correlates with Oncotype Dx RS scores, suggesting that image-based features could also predict the likelihood of recurrence and magnitude of chemotherapy benefit.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Swain, Sandra M</author><author>Nunes, Raquel</author><author>Yoshizawa, Carl</author><author>Rothney, Megan</author><author>Sing, Amy P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative Gene Expression by Recurrence Score in ER-Positive Breast Cancer, by Age</title><secondary-title>Advances in Therapy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Therapy</full-title></periodical><pages>1222-1236</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>0741-238X 1865-8652</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12325-015-0268-3</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12325-015-0268-3</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;notrelevant;pmc99;pts-ER+</label><abstract>Introduction: Breast cancer in young women (&lt;50 years) has been associated with an increased risk of recurrence and decreased survival compared with patients older than 50. The objective of this analysis was to determine, from a large database of patients with early-stage breast cancer, if the Recurrence Score® result (Oncotype DX®, Genomic Health, Inc, Redwood City, CA, USA) provided clinically meaningful differences in predicted risk of recurrence in younger—compared with older—patients. Methods: Tumor samples from patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers that were successfully processed in the Genomic Health central lab between June 2004 and December 2013 for Recurrence Score and quantitative gene expression of ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and Her/2neu, were included. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the distribution of scores by age group: &lt;40, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, and ≥70 years, nodal status, and histologic subtype. Results: Specimens from 394,031 patients [3.3% (n = 13,029) aged &lt;40 years; 15.6% (n = 61,643) aged ≥70 years] were included; 81.6% of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma. Nodal status was specified for 362,001 patients (87.0% negative). Median Recurrence Score results were similar across risk groups. Low (&lt;18)- and high (≥31)- risk Recurrence Score results were seen in 58.5% and 8.5% of patients, respectively. A greater proportion of patients aged &lt;40 (14.1%) than ≥70 (8.8%) years had a high-risk score. ER expression increased as a function of age and PR single-gene and invasion gene group expression were similar across age groups. Conclusion: These data indicate that in patients with ER-positive breast cancer, age alone does not reflect the underlying individual tumor biology, suggesting that the Recurrence Score result may add potentially useful information for personalized treatment decisions.

Pathologic and clinical factors such as tumor size, grade, and patient age also provide independent prognostic utility. We developed a formal integration of these measures and evaluated its prognostic and predictive value. Patients and Methods: From the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel (NSABP) B-14 and translational research cohort of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (TransATAC) studies, we included patients who received hormonal monotherapy, had ER-positive tumors, and RS and traditional clinicopathologic factors assessed (647 and 1,088, respectively). Individual patient risk assessments from separate Cox models were combined using meta-analysis to form an RS-pathology-clinical (RSPC) assessment of distant recurrence risk. Risk assessments by RS and RSPC were compared in node-negative (N0) patients. RSPC was compared with RS for predicting chemotherapy benefit in NSABP B-20. Results: RSPC had significantly more prognostic value for distant recurrence than did RS (P &lt; .001) and showed better separation of risk in the study population. RSPC classified fewer patients as intermediate risk (17.8% v 26.7%, P &lt; .001) and more patients as lower risk (63.8% v 54.2%, P &lt; .001) than did RS among 1,444 N0 ER-positive patients. In B-20, the interaction of RSPC with chemotherapy was not statistically significant (P = .10), in contrast to the previously reported significant interaction of RS with chemotherapy (P = .037). Conclusion: RSPC refines the assessment of distant recurrence risk and reduces the number of patients classified as intermediate risk. Adding clinicopathologic measures did not seem to enhance the value of RS alone nor the individual biology RS identifies in predicting chemotherapy benefit.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Gong</author><author>Shak, Steven</author><author>Paik, Soonmyung</author><author>Anderson, Stewart J</author><author>Costantino, Joseph P</author><author>Geyer, Charles E</author><author>Mamounas, Eleftherios P</author><author>Wickerham, D Lawrence</author><author>Wolmark, Norman</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of the prognostic and predictive utilities of the 21-gene Recurrence Score assay and Adjuvant! for women with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer: results from NSABP B-14 and NSABP B-20</title><secondary-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</full-title></periodical><pages>133-142</pages><volume>127</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><isbn>0167-6806 1573-7217</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10549-010-1331-z</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10549-010-1331-z</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;compare-Adjuvant!;done;em-disease free survival;em-distant recurrence;em-hazard ratio;fpb-focus-patient benefit from chemo;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>The Oncotype DX® Recurrence Score® (RS) is a validated genomic predictor of outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in ER-positive breast cancer. Adjuvant! was developed using SEER registry data and results from the Early Breast Cancer Clinical Trialists’ overview analyses to estimate outcome and benefit from adjuvant hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. In this report we compare the prognostic and predictive utility of these two tools in node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer. RS and Adjuvant! results were available from 668 tamoxifen-treated NSABP B-14 patients: 227 tamoxifen-treated NSABP B-20 patients, and 424 chemotherapy-plus-tamoxifen-treated B-20 patients. Adjuvant! results were also available from 1952 B-20 patients. The primary endpoint was distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI). Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare the prognostic and predictive utility of RS and Adjuvant!. Both RS (p&lt;0.001) and Adjuvant! (p=0.002) provided strong independent prognostic information in tamoxifen-treated patients. Combining RS and individual clinicopathologic characteristics provided greater prognostic discrimination than combining RS and the composite Adjuvant!. In the B-20 cohort with RS results (n=651), RS was significantly predictive of chemotherapy benefit (interaction p=0.031 for DRFI, p=0.011 for overall survival [OS], p=0.082 for disease-free survival [DFS]), but Adjuvant! was not (interaction p=0.99, p=0.311 and p=0.357, respectively). However, in the larger B-20 sub-cohort (n=1952), Adjuvant! was significantly predictive of chemotherapy benefit for OS (interaction p=0.009) but not for DRFI (p=0.219) or DFS (p=0.099). Prognostic estimates can be optimized by combining RS and clinicopathologic information instead of simply combining RS and Adjuvant!. RS should be used for estimating relative chemotherapy benefit.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thaker, Nikhil G</author><author>Hoffman, Karen E</author><author>Stauder, Michael C</author><author>Shaitelman, Simona F</author><author>Strom, Eric A</author><author>Tereffe, Welela</author><author>Smith, Benjamin D</author><author>Perkins, George H</author><author>Huo, Lei</author><author>Munsell, Mark F</author><author>Pusztai, Lajos</author><author>Buchholz, Thomas A</author><author>Woodward, Wendy A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 21-gene recurrence score complements IBTR!

METHODS: A database of patients with hormone receptor-positive, lymph node-negative, breast cancer was created for those tumors that were sent for Oncotype Dx testing from the University of Michigan Health System from 1/24/2005 to 2/25/2013.Retrospective chart review abstracted details of tumor location, histopathology, distance between tumors, Oncotype Dx results, and chemotherapy recommendations. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty-six patients for whom Oncotype Dx testing was sent were identified, with 22 patients having multiple breast tumor specimens sent. Of the 22 patients who had multiple samples sent for analysis, chemotherapy recommendations were changed in 6 of 22 patients (27%) based on significant differences in Oncotype Dx Recurrence Scores. Qualitatively, there seems to be a greater difference in genetic profile in tumors appearing simultaneously on different breasts when compared to multiple tumors on the same breast. There was no association between distance between tumors and difference in Oncotype Dx scores for tumors on the same breast. CONCLUSIONS: Oncotype Dx testing on multiple primary breast cancers altered management in regards to chemotherapy recommendations and should be considered for multiple primary breast cancers.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Trosman, Julia R</author><author>Van Bebber, Stephanie L</author><author>Phillips, Kathryn A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coverage Policy Development for Personalized Medicine: Private Payer Perspectives on Developing Policy for the 21-Gene Assay</title><secondary-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Oncology Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>238-242</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><isbn>1554-7477 1935-469X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1200/JOP.000075</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jop.ascopubs.org/cgi/doi/10.1200/JOP.000075</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;fi-focus-insurance;pmc13</label><abstract>A challenge of personalized medicine is the limited clinical evidence for many personalized medicine technologies.

We assessed time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer as well as factors associated with delay to help identify targets for future efforts to reduce unnecessary delays. Methods: Using data from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Outcomes Database, we assessed the time from pathological diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy (TTC) among 6622 women with stage I to stage III breast cancer diagnosed from 2003 through 2009 and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in nine NCCN centers. Multivariable models were constructed to examine factors associated with TTC. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Mean TTC was 12.0 weeks overall and increased over the study period. A number of factors were associated with a longer TTC. The largest effects were associated with therapeutic factors, including immediate postmastectomy reconstruction (2.7 weeks; P &lt; .001), re-excision (2.1 weeks; P &lt; .001), and use of the 21-gene reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (2.2 weeks; P &lt; .001). In comparison with white women, a longer TTC was observed among black (1.5 weeks; P &lt; .001) and Hispanic (0.8 weeks; P &lt; .001) women. For black women, the observed disparity was greater among women who transferred their care to the NCCN center after diagnosis (Pinteraction = .008) and among women with Medicare vs commercial insurance (Pinteraction &lt; .001). Conclusions: Most observed variation in TTC was related to use of appropriate therapeutic interventions. This suggests the importance of targeted efforts to minimize potentially preventable causes of delay, including inefficient transfers in care or prolonged appointment wait times.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Varga, Zsuzsanna</author><author>Sinn, Peter</author><author>Fritzsche, Florian</author><author>von Hochstetter, Arthur</author><author>Noske, Aurelia</author><author>Schraml, Peter</author><author>Tausch, Christoph</author><author>Trojan, Andreas</author><author>Moch, Holger</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>van Diest, Paul</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of EndoPredict and Oncotype DX Test Results in Hormone Receptor Positive Invasive Breast Cancer</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e58483</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0058483</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058483</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;compare-EP-test;done;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;pts-HR+;tissue-past;tos-retrospective</label><abstract>Aim: Several multigene expression-based tests offering prognostic and predictive information in hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer were established during the last years.

Our previous studies have shown that α-Tocopherol-associated protein (TAP), a vitamin E binding protein, may function as a tumor suppressor-like factor in breast carcinogenesis. The current study addresses the association of TAP expression with breast cancer clinical outcomes. Methods: Immunohistochemical stain for TAP was applied to a tissue microarray from a breast cancer cohort consisting of 271 patients with a median follow-up time of 5.2 years. The expression of TAP in tumor cells was compared with patient’s clinical outcome at 5 years after diagnosis. The potential role of TAP in predicting outcome was also assessed in clinically relevant subsets of the cohort. In addition, we compared TAP expression and Oncotype DX scores in an independent breast cancer cohort consisting of 71 cases. Results: We demonstrate that the expression of TAP was differentially expressed within the breast cancer cohort, and that ER+/PR ± tumors were more likely to exhibit TAP expression. TAP expression was associated with an overall lower recurrence rate and a better 5-year survival rate. This association was primarily in patients with ER+ tumors; exploratory analysis showed that this association was strongest in patients with node-positive tumors and was independent of stage and treatment with chemotherapy. TAP expression in ER/PR negative or triple negative tumors had no association with clinical outcome. In addition, we did not observe an association between TAP expression and Oncotype DX recurrence score. Conclusions: The significant positive association we found for α-Tocopherol-associated protein with outcome in breast cancer may help to better define and explain studies addressing α-tocopherol’s association with cancer risk and outcome. Additionally, further studies to validate and extend these findings may allow TAP to serve as a breast-specific prognostic marker in breast cancer patients, especially in those patients with ER+ tumors.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Woltmann, Andrea</author><author>Chen, Bowang</author><author>Lascorz, Jesús</author><author>Johansson, Robert</author><author>Eyfjörd, Jorunn E</author><author>Hamann, Ute</author><author>Manjer, Jonas</author><author>Enquist-Olsson, Kerstin</author><author>Henriksson, Roger</author><author>Herms, Stefan</author><author>Hoffmann, Per</author><author>Hemminki, Kari</author><author>Lenner, Per</author><author>Försti, Asta</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Wanjin, Hong</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic Pathway Enrichment Analysis of a Genome-Wide Association Study on Breast Cancer Survival Reveals an Influence of Genes Involved in Cell Adhesion and Calcium Signaling on the Patients’ Clinical Outcome</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>e98229</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1932-6203</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0098229</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0098229</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;notrelevant;pmc99</label><abstract>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) may help to understand the effects of genetic polymorphisms on breast cancer (BC) progression and survival. However, they give only a focused view, which cannot capture the tremendous complexity of this disease. Therefore, we investigated data from a previously conducted GWAS on BC survival for enriched pathways by different enrichment analysis tools using the two main annotation databases Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The goal was to identify the functional categories (GO terms and KEGG pathways) that are consistently overrepresented in a statistically significant way in the list of genes generated from the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The SNPs with allelic p-value cut-offs 0.005 and 0.01 were annotated to the genes by excluding or including a 20 kb up-and down-stream sequence of the genes and analyzed by six different tools. We identified eleven consistently enriched categories, the most significant ones relating to cell adhesion and calcium ion binding. Moreover, we investigated the similarity between our GWAS and the enrichment analyses of twelve published gene expression signatures for breast cancer prognosis. Five of them were commonly used and commercially available, five were based on different aspects of metastasis formation and two were developed from meta-analyses of published prognostic signatures. This comparison revealed similarities between our GWAS data and the general and the specific brain metastasis gene signatures as well as the Oncotype DX signature. As metastasis formation is a strong indicator of a patient’s prognosis, this result reflects the survival aspect of the conducted GWAS and supports cell adhesion and calcium signaling as important pathways in cancer progression.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yamauchi, Hideko</author><author>Nakagawa, Chizuko</author><author>Yamashige, Shinji</author><author>Takei, Hiroyuki</author><author>Yagata, Hiroshi</author><author>Yoshida, Atsushi</author><author>Hayashi, Naoki</author><author>Hornberger, John</author><author>Yu, Tiffany</author><author>Chao, Calvin</author><author>Yoshizawa, Carl</author><author>Nakamura, Seigo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Societal cost-effectiveness analysis of the 21-gene assay in estrogen-receptor–positive, lymph-node–negative early-stage breast cancer in Japan</title><secondary-title>BMC Health Services Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC Health Services Research</full-title></periodical><pages>372</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>1472-6963</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1472-6963-14-372</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-14-372</url></web-urls></urls><label>DONE;Oncotype DX;fe-focus-economic;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-present;tos-cohort</label><abstract>Background: Breast-cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing in Japan. Japanese-specific clinical validity and utility data for the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX® Breast Cancer Assay; Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, USA) are now available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 21-gene assay for the guidance of adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in estrogen-receptor–positive, lymph-node–negative, early-stage breast cancer patients, from the Japanese societal perspective. Methods: The recurrence risk group distribution by the 21-gene assay result and the assay’s influence on adjuvant chemotherapy recommendations were obtained from a study of 104 patients.

Here we present a computational method for prediction of gene signatures and blood/urine protein markers for breast cancer grades and stages based on RNA-seq data, which are retrieved from the TCGA breast cancer dataset and cover 111 pairs of disease and matching adjacent noncancerous tissues with pathologists-assigned stages and grades. By applying a differential expression and an SVM-based classification approach, we found that 324 and 227 genes in cancer have their expression levels consistently up-regulated vs. their matching controls in a grade- and stage-dependent manner, respectively. By using these genes, we predicted a 9-gene panel as a gene signature for distinguishing poorly differentiated from moderately and well differentiated breast cancers, and a</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yerushalmi, Rinat</author><author>Raiter, Annat</author><author>Nalbandyan, Karen</author><author>Hardy, Britta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cell surface GRP78: A potential marker of good prognosis and response to chemotherapy in breast cancer</title><secondary-title>Oncology Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Oncology Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>2149-2155</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><isbn>1792-1074 1792-1082</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3892/ol.2015.3579</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ol.2015.3579</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;done;em-hazard ratio;fpp-focus-patient prognosis;pmc99;pts-node-neg ER+;tissue-past;tos-cohort</label><abstract>The 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) is a stress induced heat shock protein which, under limiting conditions, functions as a cell surface signaling receptor. Tumor cells are considered to be subjected to a physiologically stressful microenvironment due to their excessive growth. The role of GRP78 in tumor survival has been of notable interest. The present study aimed to assess the potential prognostic and predictive value of cell surface GRP78 expression in breast cancer tumor cells. Cell surface and cytoplasmic expression of GRP78 was examined by immunohistochemical staining of GRP78 in breast cancer archival paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. The cohort studied included breast cancer patients with operable T1,2, estrogen receptor-positive, node-negative cancer who were assessed using the Oncotype DX gene profile, as well as patients with locally advanced disease prior to and following neoadjuvant systemic treatment. GRP78 values were compared between the 2 groups, and prior to and following systemic treatment. Association analyses between GRP78 expression and prognostic markers were also performed. Cox regression analysis was used to examine the impact of these variables on disease-free survival (DFS). No differences in cytoplasmic GRP78 expression were observed. By contrast, the rates of cell surface GRP78 expression were 74.1% in the early stage operable patients, 36% in neoadjuvant systemic treatment patients prior to treatment and 62.5% in patients following systemic treatment (P&lt;0.039). Positive cell surface GRP78 expression was associated with increased expression of the progesterone receptor (P=0.024), p53 expression (P=0.022) and improved DFS (P=0.047). In the case of GRP78 positivity, a trend for a superior response to chemotherapy was observed (P=0.19). The results of the present study indicated that cell surface GRP78 may be used as a marker for good prognosis in breast cancer and a potential marker for response to chemotherapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="132-roger.enl" path="132-roger.enl">132-roger.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yin, Zhi-Qiang</author><author>Liu, Jian-Jun</author><author>Xu, Ying-Chun</author><author>Yu, Jian</author><author>Ding, Guo-Hui</author><author>Yang, Feng</author><author>Tang, Lei</author><author>Liu, Bao-Hong</author><author>Ma, Yue</author><author>Xia, Yu-Wei</author><author>Lin, Xiao-Lin</author><author>Wang, Hong-Xia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A 41-gene signature derived from breast cancer stem cells as a predictor of survival</title><secondary-title>Journal of Experimental &amp; Clinical Cancer Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Experimental &amp; Clinical Cancer Research</full-title></periodical><pages>49</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><isbn>0392-9078 1756-9966</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1756-9966-33-49</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-9966-33-49</url></web-urls></urls><label>Oncotype DX;notrelevant;pmc99</label><abstract>Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a 41-gene signature derived from breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) to estimate the risk of metastasis and survival in breast cancer patients.
